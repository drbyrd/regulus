        <discription><![CDATA[<p>Here is a book that you will enjoy reading — no matter what your beliefs or affiliations‚ — because it will give you an insight into the fascinating practices and customs of the peoples of the East and ancient worlds from which our civilization sprang.
  <br><br>
A personal account of witnessing native ceremonies, conversations with mystical teachers and austere high priests of the Near and Far East. It takes you to rites in the interior of Africa and to temples in Peru, India, Egypt, and other exotic lands. This is no mere travel book; the author was privileged, because of his Rosicrucian affiliation, to see and learn that which is not ordinarily revealed.
<br><br>
You are taken by this book into the heart of the Great Pyramid, where there is performed a fascinating ceremony on an eventful day — a ceremony performed for the first time after three thousand years. You meet, through the author, adepts, masters, and teachers of the Hermetic Orders of Europe.
<br><br>
You are invited to look behind the scenes of the conditions existing in the countries of Asia Minor, to learn why these countries have always played such a prominent and decisive part in all of the great wars of the world. If you love mysticism, adventure, and travel, this book will gratify you.</p>]]></discription>
