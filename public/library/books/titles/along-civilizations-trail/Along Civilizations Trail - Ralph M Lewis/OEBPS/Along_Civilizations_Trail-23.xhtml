			<p class="First-paragraph"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">S</span><span class="All-Caps">o ceaseless and </span>yet so unchanging is the sea. To ancient eyes that peered across its wastes from the bows of frail craft, it too, was either a roaring fury with deep valleys whose mountainous walls were tipped with lacy foam, or a placid glass-like calm. Of all of the things of the world, the sea alone seems untouched by the moods of man or nature. As we gaze into it today we see, mirrored in our consciousness, the same vision which men who looked upon it in centuries past experienced. It remains an unbroken, unscathed bond with the beginning of time. Perhaps it was the spirit of oneness with all that had gone before, which the inky waters instilled in me as I looked over them from the deck of our motor ship, that made me think of the great personalities who had sailed this same sea.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Just a few hours before we had departed from the modern docks of Istanbul and now we were leaving the sea of Marmora and entering the straits of the Dardanelles. At this point, two great continents, Europe and Asia, were separated by a scant watery thread three to four miles in width. It was as if nature had symbolized, by this geographic arrangement, that the peoples of these enormous land areas should often embrace each other’s’ customs and habits and yet by the slender thread of racial differences ever be separated.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The ancient name of the Dardanelles—a narrow body of water forty-seven miles long—is the Hellespont. It separates the Marmora and Aegean seas. It is related to have derived its modern name from the city of Dardonis. Here, too, Xerxes, Persian King in the Sixth Century B.C., built a floating bridge—composed of a series of small boats lashed together—and crossed with his vast Army of the East for one of the earliest invasions of Europe. This same site, within the century, had been the scene of other great armies struggling for possession of its natural gateway to the Black Sea, and the great territory of Russia. During the first World War, the German and Turkish powers had fortified the slopes on either side of the Dardanelles, so as to make it almost impregnable. The British Navy was mainly assigned the task, by the allies, of penetrating the Straits, running the gauntlet, it may be said, and opening the water route to the Black Sea. Russia, an ally, needed this outlet to the Mediterranean very badly. British ships were blown to bits in the mine-infested waters and by the bombardment of heavy land batteries.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The strategy of the Turks, under German military guidance, cost England thousands of Canadian and Australian troops. After severe return assaults on the land batteries by the British cruisers, one suddenly ceased firing, and after a length of time it was believed to have been silenced. The troops prepared to land and when they had but touched the shore an inferno broke loose. Heavy artillery shells crashed about them and machine guns rattled, mowing down wave after wave of men. Retreat from the trap was impossible and advance was suicide. Britain became the eventual victor of the engagement by a small margin, for which she paid a terrific price in human lives.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Turkey remains today a steadfast ally of Germany, though making overtures of friendship to England. Every third man in impoverished Turkey is in uniform and all have the military bearing and stamp of German training. After the World War Turkey solicited a continuation of German officership of her forces, in exchange for certain trade concessions to the Reich. At this time, the system is so thoroughly organized that in only the highest ranks, and then in an advisory capacity, is it necessary for German officers to remain. Turkey’s own officers now know only one military technique—German. In Turkey, also, the army has the same outstanding prestige that it does in Germany. No other class of citizenry receives the privileges or the distinctions of the army. To Americans and to Canadians, this may seem deplorable and indicating a warlike spirit. On the other hand, our survival-of-the fittest contest is strictly along economic lines—clashes between capital and labor—attempts at an adjustment of consumption and production, but with these other powers, it means a fight for actual existence as a sovereignty.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To become weak in military strength is to be absorbed literally over night by a stronger nation; consequently the attitude is: defense of national existence must precede economic and cultural interests.</p>

			<p class="Photo-caption">From a grilled arch of the quadrangle of the blue Mosque, we look out upon the stately, impressive beauty of Saint Sophia, the greatest of all of the mosques.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A slow rolling of our ship accompanied our entrance into the Aegean Sea. To our starboard side, but two or three miles distant, were the rugged mountains of the Island of Lemnos. Frater Brower and I stepped to the railing to scan them through binoculars. Deep in their clefts, near the shoreline, here and there, were small villages appearing as though they had been washed down from the heights to wedge fast, and there, like sheltered vegetation, flourish. To the northwest, not more than fifty miles beyond our range of vision, lay historic Macedonia. In what is now known as the Thessalonike Peninsula, of Macedonia, once existed the small outpost colony city of Stagira. In it, about 384 B.C. was born a man who was to fashion the thought of the world for over 2000 years and command its respect for centuries more. It was here that Aristotle, son of the physician to the King of Macedonia, and descendant of a long line of physicians, began his career.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Each island, each peak, bay or inlet about us constituted a landmark, not in the history of races, nations, or men, but of thought. Surrounding this small sea were born and lived more men who contributed to the advancement of thought than in any similar area on the surface of the earth and in the history of man. Genius after genius sprang from the hearty mountainous region. It was as though it had been impregnated by Divine touch with the seeds of wisdom.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Over the port side loomed the silhouette of another nearby island. Its coast line was so precipitous that it plunged from a height directly into the sea, affording little beach. The late afternoon sun was concealed behind its hills, causing a back-lighting and a radiant aura to extend around and sharpen its rugged contour. This was Mytilene or the renowned island of Lesbos which played a prominent part in Aristotle’s life. Students of philosophy and of Aristotleanism divide Aristotle’s life into three distinct periods. The first and perhaps the most prominent was from his seventeenth to thirty-seventh years, when he was a disciple and constant companion of Plato. His writings during this period had the formal pedagogic style of Plato’s dialogues and his doctrines reflected the principles of his teacher. He lived in Athens and never journeyed far from the academy.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The second period, called the Wanderjahre, was after his master’s death and was devoted to travel. His contact with other schools of thought, and his own experiments and conceptions, caused his writings of this period to contrast sharply with his former ones. It was during this period of travel that he spent two years of study on Lesbos, the island before us. Here he gathered specimens of marine life and carefully observed their habits. It is said that from these observations there came about his famous doctrine of development, which was the first theory of evolution. He attempted to unite by his theory two realms of reality—mind, or the initial ideas as Plato called them, and matter. What a surge of wisdom flowed through the small channel of this one human mind! He attempted the first classification of all natural phenomena—grouping inanimate matter, plant and animal life, into separate divisions and making possible the first truly scientific study. He devised the term metaphysics, meaning beyond physics, to define the study of the causes of physical phenomena, in fact, the first causes of all being. He gave the name psychology to that branch of study concerned with the Soul and the functions of mind, thought, sensation, perception. Merely as an aid to assist his reasoning and to make his insight into the profound problems which he considered clearer, he invented the system of formal logic, which is still in use today with slight variation.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">No greater test of wisdom or its relevancy to truth can be had than that it be subjected to the passing of time. The titles which Aristotle bestowed upon the divisions of reality he made have endured, and many of his fundamental doctrines remain unshaken by sieges of controversy. It seems incredible that one mind could conceive such truths, become so enlightened by its own efforts during one normal life’s span. As further tribute to his greatness, may it be said that he, far more than his contemporaries and his later followers, realized and admitted his limitations, this bleak body of land, therefore, seemingly spewed up from the sea, provided not a source of great mineral or vegetable wealth to protect or sustain the bodies of men, but a natural laboratory from which came ideas that nourished the minds of men for centuries.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Eighty miles west of Stagira, Aristotle’s birthplace, was located the City of Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia, over which presided Phillip II. His fame having spread, Aristotle was urged by Phillip to become the private tutor of his son, Alexander, who was destined to become a world conqueror. It was said he accepted the appointment because of the opportunity it provided to test his political theories. His pupil, later, while on an expedition of conquest, had a selected staff of sages collect and send back to Aristotle, for his examination and study, strange plants and specimens of minerals and soil. Vicious gossip and the jealousy of Alexander poisoned his mind toward his master and teacher, while he was on a distant campaign. Eventually Aristotle fled to Chalcis, on the elongated island of Euboea, which was now directly west of us, but beyond our vision. There he died in 322 B.C. In recent years, just outside of where existed the small colonial city of Eretria, about twelve miles south of Chalcis, excavators unearthed a gold stylus, ring, and pieces of pottery which were said to be Aristotle’s. In the grave was also found a skull, which is believed to be his as well.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The eastern shore of Asia had faded from our view. We were now directly off the coast of the ancient Ionians. During the glory of the Greek schools of philosophy it was said that, of all of the colonies of Attica, Ionia provided those who excelled in the love of inquiry into nature—in other words, those who inclined toward what we consider the physical sciences. The principal city and capital of Ionia was Miletus, in which flourished the earliest school of philosophy. The founder was Thales, 585 B.C., who is said to have predicted an eclipse. There began with him a transition from the theogony of the gods, the common belief in Greece at that time, to physical philosophy, which sought to explain the universe along rational, and what we might term scientific, lines. Thales sought an ultimate substance, a primary element from which all things came, and he finally concluded that substance to be water. The school ceased with the destruction of that city by the Persians in 494 B.C. Nearly opposite from Miletus, across the Aegean, was the City of Megara, where certain lesser Socratic schools, those expounding a version of the Socratic philosophy, came into existence but never into prominence.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">With such enjoyment had I lived in my mind the lives and accomplishments of these astute personalities of thousands of years past, that I had not become conscious of the hour. The clashing sound of the dining steward’s dinner gong brought me to an awareness of a keen hunger induced by the invigorating sea air.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We retired to our stateroom early, but I could not sleep. My imagination had been stimulated by these monuments, these reminders of a great past civilization. Perching myself on the berth, in a position so I could look out of the porthole, I opened it and stared down at the water a few feet below, which seemed to rush past. The light of the stateroom cast a faint glow upon the sea. The small circle of light was sufficient to intensify the darkness of the water and give the foam a contrasting scintillating whiteness. With my back to the room, and before me visible only this small illuminated circle of the sea, and with the freshness of the salt air stinging my face, I had a full sense of appreciation of the beauty, majesty and wildness of this element. For miles, on and on, the water rolled, rose to crests, broke, lashed, and slid into great wallows: the sky reaching down on all sides was its only container. What it held close to its bosom fathoms below and immediately beneath me, perhaps no man would ever know. I thought if there is on earth any power or agency of nature which displays a spirit of complete freedom and a disregard for the efforts of man to control it, it is the sea. Use it man can, but never is he its master.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The following morning the decks were bathed in sunlight. It was enjoyed in sheltered corners for the air was biting. Land had not been seen for hours, but there was no possibility for monotony as preparations by passengers and crew alike were being made for the arrival at the port of Piraeus. By the time Frater Brower and I had repacked our cinema equipment, after having filmed the notable sights we had passed, we were entering the Gulf of Aegina. In this gulf some of the greatest naval battles of the ancient world were fought. These battles gave Attica the supremacy that assured her independence and perhaps preserved her spirit of inquiry and love of knowledge. Persia had constantly menaced the security of Attica, under the leadership of Darius. Xerxes, his son, at the death of his father, continued the campaigns against Greece. Success crowned first the efforts of one side, then of the other. A powerful Persian fleet sailed one day into the port of Piraeus, and only the strong Athenian army stationed on the shore kept it from landing. Themistocles, great statesman of Athens and Arcon, head of the state, proposed that the Athenians build a large fleet to dominate the surrounding sea and keep the Persians from crossing, as in only that way, he believed Athens safe from invasion. His proposals were well received and finally 180 ships were built and put to sea. The Athenian fleet eventually met and defeated the Persian fleet in a great naval combat in the waters immediately surrounding the Island of Salam is, slightly north and west of Piraeus, whose harbor we were now slowly entering.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We had been standing in line alongside wooden benches in the customs shed, where our baggage was piled awaiting inspection, for nearly an hour. Our estimation of the department’s efficiency was greatly diminishing, as was our patience. There was an obvious shortage in personnel, which at the time appeared to us an imposition on travelers. The inspectors were gracious enough, but their courtesy did not lessen our agitation. It was not until the next day that we became aware that Greece’s severe economic plight was responsible for the under-manned staff. For centuries Greece had been under the domination of Turkey. During the Ottoman Empire it was divided into many districts by Turkey, and like other subjugated nations of the Ottoman Empire, it was bled of resources and of the opportunities of internal expansion. Not long after obtaining its independence and following its participation in the World War, it was plunged into revolution—a struggle between monarchy and republic. Its people are thrifty and its resources, though not many, are in demand, but it has been and is still at the mercy of its more powerful neighboring states, which prevent it from obtaining the concessions it needs for a successful economic life.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Archaeological collection began in Greece as early as the Seventeenth Century. The ruins of its great edifices were so impressive that they were bound to excite curiosity and interest. It was not until the Nineteenth Century, however, that a real scientific examination of the antiquities of Greece was begun. To Lord Byron, English poet, 1788-1824, must go the credit for reawakening world interest in the magnificent history that was Greece’s, and the decaying arts which lay in Athens just below the debris of centuries.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Byron, a cripple, who traveled for health, romance, and adventure, through Europe where his works were more appreciated than in England, visited Greece and immediately felt a strong affinity for its traditions and people. To commemorate an historic event, he swam the Hellespont. Inspired by his studies there, he returned to England to compose his greatest works. Later he returned to Greece to interest himself in its political strife. He spent a considerable amount of his personal fortune to aid in her liberation. He was once offered, in return, the Governor-Generalship.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Athens nestled between two mountains. Mt. Hymettus and Mt. Pentelicus, the former having always been renowned for its honey and the latter for its excellent marble. Nature had endowed Athens with excellent elements for defense. Slightly inland, with elevations that made the sea visible and prevented sudden naval attack, and with a surrounding plain whose soil provided essential foods, such as olives, fig groves, vineyards, and good pasturage, its people were soon able to give themselves over to pursuits other than the mere acquiring of sustenance. Speaking of the climate, which is never extreme, one of the ancient philosophers wrote of it: The clear bracing air fostered intellectual and esthetic pursuits and endowed them with mental energy.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Our stay in Athens was not to be lengthy and we had much to accomplish. Consequently, after depositing our baggage at our quarters, we immediately set out to photograph those things which would be representative of the Hellenic civilization. Sporadic showers did not discourage us. The most commanding and never-to-be-forgotten sight is the Acropolis, a large promontory, 1000 feet in length or about two of our city blocks, on which temples to the gods and fortresses with protective walls have been erected since Neolithic times.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Modern Archaeology has located the remnants of the numerous gates of Themistocles’ wall which surrounded it and through which trod many of the eminent of Greece’s past. Not far from the Dipylon Gate was the Academy of Plato, where his students came to hear his learned discourses and to hear him inveigh against the Sophists. But a short distance from still another gate is said to be the site of the Lyceum, the school of the peripatetics, where Aristotle expounded truths to his disciples, as they walked to and fro with him.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We wended our way up and through a wooded section known as the Pynx. After a brisk walk we stopped before an enormous rock pitted with age, in which there are two cave-like chambers with benches hewn out of the living rock and giving evidence of once having been occupied by humans. The entrances now have iron gateways, which are opened by attendants. An exhilarating sensation swept over me when I was told that I stood in the prison cell of Socrates in which—Plato’s dialogue, the Phaedo, informs us—the great Sage drank the hemlock. It is difficult to express the emotions we felt, as Plato s masterfully drawn word picture of the execution of Socrates occupied our thoughts in the very place where it is supposed to have occurred. However, we reluctantly drew ourselves back to the reality of fact, that in all probability, from an Archaeological point of view, these caves, of which there were others, were part of a prehistoric city which surrounded the Acropolis.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Nearby was the Aeropagus, commonly called Mars Hill, on which, it is generally held by historians, the Apostle Paul preached to the Athenians. The structures which now stand upon the Acropolis were built after the Persians had destroyed all of the previous edifices and left them in smoldering ruins.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Conceded to be one of the Seven Wonders of the World is the magnificent Parthenon, the great temple erected, on the Acropolis, to the glory of the Goddess Athena. One stands before it overwhelmed at its beauty. Even though it is in partial ruins, there clings to its great Doric columns an atmosphere, in effect, like a heavy perfume, which so overpowers the senses that naught but its exotic presence can be realized. As I walked along the marble flagging of a peristyle and gazed between the graceful columns at the city lying below, I wondered what thoughts must have occupied the great minds which assembled here on occasion. Were such idealists limited in the range of their concepts to a mere consideration of the problems and affairs of their day, or did they at times separate themselves in mind from their environment and in suck an inspiring setting envision the future of the world 2500 years hence? Could they have imagined that men of other races, centuries later, would pass through the structures they had planned and built? Could they feel that their work in many of the arts was so original, so far-reaching, that their influence would be felt thousands of generations into the future? Would these men, if alive today, choose our times in preference to the times in which they lived?</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After the destruction by the Persians of the earlier structures of the Acropolis, Pericles, Fifth Century B.C., statesman, orator, and lover of culture, began a great campaign for the beautification of Athens. From the campaign came artistic developments which, even today, remain foremost in the records of the achievements of man. Appropriating the enormous sum, for that time, of over two and one-half million dollars, which was derived mainly from the Athenians, he engaged the greatest Greek craftsmen and artists of the day to perform the work. Ictinus was the architect who designed and supervised the building of the Parthenon. Phidias was the sculptor who beautified it. Architect and sculptor worked hand in hand in creating these masterpieces. The columns, for the first time in the history of architecture, were caused to incline inward at the top, to give the structure the appearance of stability. To prevent the illusion of concavity they were gracefully tapered, giving the whole a symmetrical balance. Phidias sculptured a frieze of idealistic figures around the top sides of the temple. The figures, though human in form, were so perfect, depicting the ideal man and woman for which Greece strove, that they became a symbol of beauty which inspired the citizenry to emulate them. The sculpture at the gabled ends depicted the birth of the Goddess Athena and her struggle with Poseidon, God of the Sea, for possession of Attica.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Within the temple there had stood a magnificent gold and ivory statue of the Goddess Athena, thirty feet in height and wrought by the genius of Phidias. Outside of the temple was also a colossal bronze statue of this protectress of Athens. This, too, was the work of Phidias. Rising to a height of seventy feet, the figure held her shield and spear upraised in an attitude of protection of the city below. It is said that sailors returning home could see the tip of Athena’s spear glistening in the sun like a beacon of welcome when their ships rounded Mt. Hymettus. Is it a wonder that the Periclean period of history is referred to as the Golden Age?</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The days had swept by so rapidly that it was extremely difficult for us to separate them into periods spent in one country, on one continent, or in one place. We had, it seemed, in the months of our travels witnessed not a series of disconnected past events, but a continuous parade of human adventure. At no time had the threads of man’s efforts been entirely lost in the transition from one fabric of civilization to another. Decline had meant a paucity of material, a few minds working to preserve the heritage of wisdom against the contaminating influences of ignorance and superstition. These threads of genius were surrounded, in the eras of stagnation, by the drab incidents of the deterioration of human morals and thought. Let a time be favorable and the threads transformed all they touched into beauty, illumination and splendor.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Civilization is a great force put into motion by the concerted actions of men. The momentum of that force can carry it forward or backward. It depends upon the direction in which it is started. It is individual human intelligence, inspired intellect, virgin ideas and concepts which determine the direction that civilization shall take. Civilization itself does not produce this intelligence, but merely provides it with an excellent tool with which to work. Only in a degeneracy of life itself can this intelligence ever be destroyed. Civilization can and will fall again and again, and time after time from the purged ashes will arise, phoenix-like, a mind or minds which will develop another civilization, founded upon those instincts and precepts which draw men together in the hope of attaining a common good not individually possible. The only fear, and that is a remote one, is that some civilization may pervert all of the human race simultaneously and close the channels from which spring the visions which move men upward and onward.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Our journey was completed. Homeward bound, we sailed past the Rock of Gibraltar, through the legendary gates of Hercules, toward the Western world and the New Age.</p>
