			<p id="_idParaDest-7" class="Chapter-Title"><span class="All-Caps"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"></a>The Valley of the Kings</span></p>
			<p class="First-paragraph"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">B</span><span class="All-Caps">y arrangement, early </span>in the morning we met the Inspector, our dragoman, and porters on the bank of the Nile. We were fascinated by the quaint little boats with their patched sails, and their one-man crews, fighting the tide trying to reach a point directly opposite on the other shore. We watched patient little burros tread along the bank, laden with bales or crates, wits masters who either walked along in front, or behind, tapping them on their flanks with a stick to keep their pace constant. Groups of native women sat in little circles on the road edge, waiting for the return of someone patient, impervious to sun, flies, and insects. Their faces were covered, with the exception of their eyes. Most of them, unfortunately, had diseased eyes, due to the water in which they wash—when they do—and due to infection and lack of knowledge of sanitation and hygiene.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Finally we climbed aboard our frail craft with our equipment, and started across the Nile from a point where for centuries the Egyptians had crossed. As we were swept along, there came to our minds the legends of the great ancient funeral processions which had crossed this same body of water. From the East bank of the Nile—the city of the living, because the sun rose with its life-giving rays in the East—they floated across, on great decorated barges with the sarcophagus of the departed, always at dusk, representing the closing of life and the crossing from this world of the living to the world of the-dead. The West side of the Nile, therefore, or the city which existed there at that time, was called the City of the Dead, because it was in the West where the sun set at the close of day, and where darkness came.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It must have been a magnificent ceremony. We could imagine the chanting, the sound of strains of music on the river. In our minds we could hear the wailing of bereavement. We could mentally see the unloading of the sarcophagus see it being carried on backs and shoulders of great Nubian slaves. We could see priests in ornamental costumes, bedecked with jewelry, emblems of their office, marching two abreast ahead, swaying from side to side in time with the rhythm of chanting and music. Behind came the military escort, the members of the court and the family of the departed. Behind them came, piled high on the backs of personal slaves, the intimate belongings of the departed—great alabaster chests inlaid with ivory, hand-beaten gold masks and vessels, gems, rare woods, frankincense, pottery, beautiful tiles, magnificent furniture, hand-carved, showing great skill and craftsmanship. The procession would wend its way into the hills that became the tombs of the great—of the kings of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth dynasties.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Our musing soon ended as our boat slid alongside the crude landing. We loaded our equipment into a ramshackle car to be driven over a rough, ungraded road as far as possible, and from there to be packed on the backs of our porters. We started through this little valley with its towering limestone cliffs. Here were buried the Theban kings—some forty-one of their tombs have now been located. We eventually entered various ones, going down their long, sloping passageways or ramps, observing painted on the walls the original diagrams showing the plan of construction. We learned that these plans were quite frequently deceptive, intended to mislead any vandals who might break into the tomb, as to its real arrangement. Treasure rooms were usually sealed in such a manner that it would take considerable investigation to locate them. When our torches were temporarily extinguished for a moment, and we realized the inky blackness of these underground chapels and mortuaries, the sensation was real.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">On the walls were prayers in adoration of the gods, also inscriptions from the rituals which the deceased would have to perform in the after-world. There still remained some of the great stone sarcophagi or coffins from which the mummified remains had been recently removed, or which were empty when recently excavated. These tombs of kings were not as interesting historically, nor did they contribute as much to our knowledge of the times and of the people and their customs, as the tombs of the lords or noblemen. The inscriptions and hieroglyphics on the walls of these tombs of the kings were mostly concerned with their personal accomplishments, and self-aggrandizement, and with phrases from the great Book of the Dead, a book containing the rituals and ceremonies of the after-life. However, we did film the tombs of Rameses III, Seti II, and the one of the renowned King Tutankhamen, and others. The heat was unbearable to us who were not accustomed to it. The only shade was that afforded by the interior of the tombs themselves. The cliffs were barren, rugged, ghastly. They suggested another world—<span class="Italic-Basic">a world of the dead</span>. They were used principally because they were the only stone hills in the immediate vicinity which would afford construction material for tombs.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We went, then, after a few minutes journey, to the tombs of the nobles—that class of individuals who sprang up during the feudal age of Egypt and became wealthy and powerful, and who rivaled the power of the kings. They owned great estates, worked by both freemen and slaves, and built luxurious palace homes with mosaic floors depicting the cool waters of the Nile, and the green grasses which grow about it. The walls were ornamented with paintings of water fowl common at the time. These nobles enjoyed all the luxuries which the time afforded—beautiful furniture, tapestries, fruits, wines and vegetables—many of which we have inherited, such as romaine salad wonderful jewelry made of gold and rare stones. They had great crops of grain, and skilled workmen, basket makers, cabinet makers, metal workers. These craftsmen had tools of bronze—saws, hammers, and many implements similar to those we employ today.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">On the walls of the tombs of these nobles, painted in vivid colors—startlingly vivid to us, for it seemed almost unbelievable that the colors could be so bright after the centuries that had passed over them—were incidents in the lives of the people of the estates. Thus we know how they were employed, what they did. There are scenes showing the gathering of grain, showing the scribe recording the bushels. Scenes showing the crushing of the grapes, and making of wine. Others show the tilling of fields with ploughs; and we see in these first ploughs used a similarity to ours of today. The Egyptians of this period had gone beyond hoe-culture and had developed agriculture. We see irrigation canals, the first in the world. We see the chariot makers; we note the fishermen preparing to set out with their nets. We note the intimate family life of the noble. Here he is entertaining guests, with children playing in the same room at a game that resembles our draughts or checkers. We observe that the noble had but one wife, whom he respected and who shared equally with him all of his powers, privileges, and property rights. Here, on the walls of these tombs, history is unfolded.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We then visited splendid Der-EI-Bahri, or the mortuary temple of Queen Hatshepsut. This great tomb-temple, now being restored to its original condition as nearly as possible, was built for Hatshepsut by her architect and vizier, Hapuseneb. Considerable enmity and jealousy existed in later life between her King husband and herself. It is related that he was envious of his wife’s power in the Egyptian empire. And later, when she died, he ordered her cartouche or signature eradicated from the great obelisks which she had erected during her time.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">On either side of the great ramp which leads to the outer court-yard of this temple-tomb we saw what seems to be just a great, dry root protruding from the sand of the desert. These two roots are all that is left of two great trees which were once on either side of that ramp and which had been imported from far up the Nile, from equatorial Africa, by emissaries of the queen so that she might have shade. It is also said, that where now there is naught but desert surrounding this temple-tomb, there were once flourishing gardens. The tomb itself is deep in the face of the cliff which is immediately behind the temple.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Our journey next brought us to the temple of Medinet Habu which was built to the god, Amon. Though mammoth in size, with gigantic columns and pylons, it reveals a decadence in architecture. The reliefs tell of the great campaigns of the pharaoh; show his naval battles; we see his mercenaries or hired soldiers capturing the revolting subjects of the countries which comprised his empire; we study the weapons they used—spears, shields, swords, armor; we examine the type of war galleys. The architecture is decadent in comparison with that of other temples we have seen because there is no uniformity of design. One finds square columns, short, ill proportioned ones, others tall and graceful, with capitals of different design, some plain, others highly ornamented. </p>

			<p class="Photo-caption">In the awe-inspiring Valley of the Queens, surrounded by age-old, gnarled, and worn cliffs, is this temple and tomb of Egypt’s most powerful Queen, Hatshepsut, wife of Amenhotep III.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Climbing to the top of a great pylon through a narrow stone passageway, we had an excellent view of the plain around it, and the Nile a mile or two distant. Where we stood, some seventy-five feet above the ground, had stood the defending warriors many times before, hurling stones or spears at the attacking invaders below.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We left Medinet Habu, and finally the Valley of the Kings, to admire—at a distance of some several hundred yards—the Colossi of Memnon. These enormous statues were erected by Amenhotep III as an outer gateway to a great temple which is no longer in existence. They were surrounded by water as the land around them was inundated by the rising Nile. It made a thrilling picture, for the clear, still water reflected their mysterious images. Completing a full day, we returned again to Luxor, but on the following day went back for further detailed photographing, as our first trip was only sufficient for us to plot out those sections or portions of all the things we saw which we believed to be the most impressive and which would convey, to future audiences who would see our films, a better impression of the greatness of that which we had the privilege of seeing personally.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It was while crossing the Nile after our second day on the West bank that Habachi said to us suddenly, “I believe I can arrange to have you film with your cinema, for the first time, an interesting demonstration which I feel will prove of interest to your friends and your countrymen.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We asked him what it was, and he stated, “I cannot comment more freely at this time, for I must inquire further before I can be certain. But if you will come to my office early tomorrow morning, I will be prepared to tell you more, I am sure.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">His way of arousing our interest to a certain point and then telling us no more was exciting, and the following morning found us early at his office. We did not know what to expect, because for the last few days he had given us entree into tombs which were ordinarily locked and barred to the public; he had ordered attendants and guards to make available to us places which are recorded only in historical texts and have never before been photographed for public examination; so We felt this would truly be something unusual.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Habachi began, “There is an Egyptian by the title and name of Sheikh Moussa-EI-Hawi, who has an unusual power of sensing or detecting by smell and other means—perhaps you will call them mystic—the presence of venomous snakes and insects. He also has the means of subduing these snakes, making them docile, although at times I understand he has been bitten by them, and in fact has lost his two sons who inherited his power of detecting snakes; they were seriously bitten.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Immediately there flashed into our minds the accounts that had been published of this individual in American magazines at different times, though of course we had never seen a picture of him and no picture had ever been published of him. I asked, “He will perform for us?” He said, “Yes, gladly, as a courtesy to me.” “When?” we chorused, and he replied, “He awaits in the courtyard and will accompany you to wherever you wish.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I asked if the demonstration could be delayed for a few minutes while we rushed to the hotel to obtain the balance of our party—Frater and Soror Harry L. Shibley and Soror Lewis. He consented, and in a few minutes we returned, breathless, for the demonstration. Naturally we wanted to assure ourselves that this was to be a genuine demonstration and not the trickery common among snake charmers in the Orient. Habachi said, “He is not a snake charmer; he has no snakes with him. He will gladly remove all his garments for your inspection and examination.” And, in fact, he did remove all his garments except his loin cloth to assure us none were concealed on his person.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Habachi continued. “He will go wherever you wish, to call out these snakes, so that you may be certain that he has not by any prearrangement placed snakes in places where he would recommend that the demonstration be held.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This was fair enough. There could be no trickery under such arrangements. We suggested, therefore, the interior of Luxor Temple. We all accompanied Sheik Moussa-EI-Hawi to Luxor Temple. He was a strange individual; his very presence caused one to shiver, to have a frigid feeling along the spine. His eyes were like a reptile’s, piercing and black. His face was strange, slightly distorted; his clothes had a peculiar odor. He looked neither to right nor to left, nor even at the ground before him as he walked ahead of us. Suddenly he stopped and said in broken English, to no one in particular but audible to all of us, “I shall now, with your consent, proceed.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Frater Brower asked Inspector Habachi, “will the snakes and insects which he calls out from the debris of the ruins be within ten, twenty-five, or fifty feet of us as we wish to know just exactly where to set up our cameras?” We had three cameras to record the incident—a professional cinema, a Graphlex still camera, and another.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Habachi spoke to him in Arabic, and then said to us in English, “He says he knows there is a scorpion right near him and a cobra not far distant.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Moussa, tilting his head backward and sniffing the air as a bloodhound would, apparently caught the scent, as he called it, of what he was searching for, and then he broke out in the weirdest chant I ever heard—a chant in Arabic, starting slowly with deep intonation, and increasing in rapidity and pitch till it eventually reached a frenzied shrill tone; repeating again and again. The man was obviously working himself into some sort of emotional state. At the height of this frenzy, and after walking about in circles from ten to twenty feet distant from us, he suddenly stopped before one of the rocks at his feet, reached down, rolled up his sleeve, baring his arm, tugged at the rock, threw it backward, and reaching in the cavity it had made suddenly brought forth a hideous golden-colored scorpion. He held the scorpion in his hand so that it was visible to us and easily photographed. We noticed that it was continually striking at him with its barbed appendage. When it pricked the flesh of his finger, he would wince at the pain, but showed little or no concern otherwise. At first this was repulsive to all of us, and yet it was so awesome and fascinating that we could not turn from his further demonstrations.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Returning the scorpion to its place, he then walked ahead for perhaps thirty-five or forty feet. We followed him. Suddenly he stopped and again went through the peculiar gesture of detecting some strange scent, and also broke forth with his incantation. Frater Brower, with my aid, hurriedly again set up the cinema equipment.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Habachi turned to us and stated, “This time it is a cobra.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">“How,” I whispered, “do you know?”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">He stated, “His chant is different.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">“What is this strange incantation?” I asked. Habachi said he was calling these serpents, as representatives of Satanical power, in the name of Allah, to expose themselves, to come forth—that a greater power than they was giving the command. Finally he stepped over to a little embankment. We noticed the embankment was pock-marked with holes. Rolling up the sleeve of his robe again, he plunged his bared arm down one of these holes to the depth of his elbow. He was apparently struggling with something. I turned to Habachi with a quizzical look on my face. Anticipating my question, he said. “He has one.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We formed a semi-circle at a safe distance behind Sheikh Moussa-El-Hawi, and finally out it came. He had pulled the cobra by its tail out of its biding place. He threw it before him. Immediately it endeavored to get away; it started to crawl back toward its hole. He increased the rapidity of his chanting and a strange light was in his eyes; his face was twisted and grotesque, and as if in a fury he jumped up and down in his bare feet in the dust before the reptile, calling it in the name of all the powers that he knew to return to him. Slowly the snake, as if it had been drawn against its will, turned and crawled back toward him, apparently fighting against some influence stronger than itself. When immediately before him, it coiled and swayed from side to side. Continually chanting, he slowly reached down, picked up the reptile which coiled its body tightly around his arm, and held it before his face. The cobra had inflated its hood and struck at him several times, but by a twist of his wrist he threw the reptile off balance so it would miss its aim and he was not bitten. All this time Frater Brower was faithfully recording this strange incident on cinema film, and as we today see the same scene on the film, we recall the strange feeling we had that this individual was not just a snake charmer but did exert some strange power over these reptiles.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The demonstration was repeated from time to time, and at the close of the last demonstration we offered him compensation, but he haughtily refused it, waved us aside with his hand, and marched on, apparently indifferent to our words of appreciation and gratitude for his demonstration. We were deeply grateful for this unusual opportunity to record this scene, and thanked Inspector Habachi profusely. (Note: Sheikh Moussa EI-Hawi died in Gizeh of a cobra bite a few months after our return, so a news cable reported.)</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The balance of the day was spent in negotiating for the purchase of an unusual collection of exhibits for the Rosicrucian Egyptian Oriental Museum relics worth a considerable sum because of their age and because they were the property of renowned personages. Each of these antiquities had to be inspected by Habachi before being exported from Egypt, as it is now the custom of the Egyptian government to permit the exportation of only those things of which it may have a likeness, and those things which are authentic, so as not to bring ridicule upon Egypt.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I will never forget the stroll we took with Habachi down to the edge of the Nile just as the sun was beginning to set. Its rosy glow spread over the water; the air was now cool and pleasant. It was our last night in Egypt; we were reluctant to leave. We were thankful to the Inspector for what he had done and had helped us to accomplish. We had just finished again expressing our gratitude, and were about to return to our hotel, expecting him to accompany us part way, when he said, “I leave you here. I am crossing the Nile.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We were surprised, and said, “At this hour? It will be quite dark before you return.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">With a peculiar smile he looked straight into my eyes and said, “I am not returning tonight. I sleep on the West Bank.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Frater Brower stated, “Oh, then you have another office, or an abode across there.” </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">He said, “My abode shall be the Temple of Medinet Habu.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Frater Brower and I looked at each other. “You are sleeping in that great temple tonight, by yourself? Why?”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Smiling again, he said, “You are students of mysticism; you are Rosicrucians, are you not?”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">“Yes,” was our reply.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">“Then you have my answer.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We were astounded. Apparently he was returning to spend the night in an environment and atmosphere of his ancient ancestors, to be surrounded by memories of their achievements, to dream of their hopes, and aspirations, to try and visualize the scenes that took place there, to gain from those great stone walls and the inscriptions, dark shadows and absolute silence, some idea of their inner ideals, of things left undone—perhaps to quicken his own consciousness, to help him carry on, to keep alive in Egypt what they had begun centuries before.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Slowly we turned and in silence left him, we to leave Egypt, to pass another milestone along civilization s trail.</p>
