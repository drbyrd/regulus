			<p id="_idParaDest-14" class="Chapter-Title"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"></a>THE OVERSOUL AND CYCLES OF INCARNATIONS </p>
			<p class="First-Paragraph"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">I</span><span class="ALL-CAPS">t has been </span>intimated in the preceding pages of this book that there is but one soul existing throughout the entire universe and this soul is the consciousness and divine essence of God. It has also been intimated that the so-called individual souls of human beings are not separate and independent souls, but <span class="Italic-Basic">unseparated segments</span> of the Universal Soul, never losing their association or contact with this consciousness of God and the divine essence which constitutes the vital life force. Because these facts may be new to a great many Western minds it seems appropriate at this moment to augment these statements with the use of schematic diagrams and symbols, and make plain the beautiful fundamental laws which are involved in the principles set forth in this book. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">That there is <span class="Italic-Basic">one soul</span> in the universe, and that this soul is the consciousness and vital essence of God should not be surprising to any devoted student of sacred literature; nor will it be surprising to those who have made a careful study of the fundamental laws of biology and ontology. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If God is the creator of all things, and from his consciousness and divine essence emanates all consciousness and all vitality, then all consciousness throughout the universe and all vital energy of a living, creative nature must have <span class="Italic-Basic">one central, divine source</span>, and must be continuous and uniform throughout the universe. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Even a moment’s reflection will reveal that it is far more difficult to think of God having created out of his consciousness and essence millions upon millions of individual souls,each retaining its distinct individuality and separateness, than it is to think of <span class="Italic-Basic">one universal essence and one universal soul</span>. To conceive of any means of maintaining individual entities of the same soul essence and same divine consciousness, without a tendency on their part to unite and blend into <span class="Italic-Basic">one essence and one consciousness, </span>is a difficult thing indeed. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">God, the creator of all things, is the Father of all images created by him in his likeness. We cannot conceive of the human children of one earthly father as being of a vital essence or blood energy so separated that the same essence is not in each of them. With the soul essence, however, we are dealing with a subtle and transcendental energy that pervades all space and which cannot be isolated or confined in any enclosure, and we cannot conceive of this essence as being in a human form without at the same time extending beyond that form and contacting the same essence resident in all other human forms. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When the sacred writings of the Orientals and even of the Christians speak of the soul in man, they do not necessarily imply an <span class="Italic-Basic">individualized</span> and <span class="Italic-Basic">separated soul</span>, but the soul essence and <span class="Italic-Basic">soul consciousness</span> of God that is resident in man. Each of us has <span class="Italic-Basic">soul</span>, but not a <span class="Italic-Basic">soul</span> in the sense that it is a <span class="Italic-Basic">thing apart from every other soul</span> in human beings. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">To illustrate the principle, or law involved, I have resorted to the homely illustration of the electricity that is utilized in the lighting of modern electric lamps. </p>
			<div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1">
				<div id="_idContainer008">
					<img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="image/Fig1.png" alt="" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Fig. 1 </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In Figure 1, I have shown the electric wires in the upper part of the drawing passing along from lamp to lamp without any break in their connections. The lamps A, C, D, E, F,G, H, and I are various types of electric bulbs common in use today. Some of them are colored with various tints;some are very small and give only a small amount of light,others are large and very luminous; some are long, and some are short. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The electricity that flows into each <span class="CharOverride-2">one </span>of these lamps,and causes the lamp bulb to be alive with light, is not broken in its continuity or in its flow through <span class="CharOverride-2">all of the lamps</span>. The electricity that illuminates these bulbs and gives them life or <span class="CharOverride-2">light</span> flows through each lamp and out again to enter into the next lamp, and so on. The electric current, therefore, in each lamp may be likened to the <span class="CharOverride-2">soul essence </span>of the lamp, and while we would say that each lamp <span class="CharOverride-2">has its own electricity</span> which it is utilizing, we cannot look upon that electricity in each lamp as <span class="CharOverride-2">being separated from or distinct from the electricity that is in all of the other lamps</span>. Merely a <span class="CharOverride-2">segment</span> of the electric circuit is resident in each lamp, and <span class="CharOverride-2">all of these segments are united </span>in one continuous circuit. Even if we separate one of the lamps from the circuit, as shown at B in the diagram, the electricity that was once resident in the bulb comes to the point or place of its former entrance into the lamp bulb, and then passes on into the next one. The lamp that no longer has the electric current passing through it is now <span class="CharOverride-2">lifeless and without light</span>. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In the lower part of Figure 1, I have compared the universal soul essence and consciousness with the electric current. The dotted circles labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H at the bottom of this diagram represent human physical bodies and the upper dark line represents the soul essence and consciousness of the universe, with segments of it coming down and passing through each of the physical bodies. You will see at once that this divine consciousness and essence, called <span class="Italic-Basic">soul,</span> is not broken into<span class="CharOverride-2"> individual</span> and <span class="CharOverride-2">separate</span> segments in each one of the physical bodies, but passes into each body and manifests there, giving the body life, yet manifests simultaneously in the other physical bodies. While the segment of soul is in one of these physical bodies it manifests consciousness, life, and intelligence in the physical body, and without this soul essence the physical body would be lifeless and without intelligence or consciousness. The dotted circle B represents a physical body after transition when the soul essence and consciousness have withdrawn from the body and left it lifeless and unconscious. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The electric lamp bulbs are not electric lights until electricity manifests in them and through them. When you buy an electric bulb at a store and carry it home with you, you have nothing more or less in your hands than some of the minerals of the earth, gathered together by a scientific process and formed into a body by the master creators of electrical devices. You cannot call it a <span class="CharOverride-2">light</span>, since it manifests no light, and it is therefore lifeless, useless, and without any value so long as it is unassociated with the electric current. The moment you place this bulb in a socket, or in a position where the electric current can flow into it, you immediately transform the lifeless, lightless, physical body of the bulb into a <span class="CharOverride-2">vibrating illuminating, living thing</span> of light, and the moment the electric current or electric essence is withdrawn from the bulb it is again lifeless and useless and cannot fulfill the purpose for which it was made. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Man’s physical body is precisely like the electric bulb. Every bit of its physical and material form and nature has been extracted from the earthly elements and drawn together by a marvelous process and formed by a Master Creator,but until the divine essence of life and consciousness enters that physical body it is lifeless and truly lightless. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This recalls to our minds the principle that is so well worded in the Christian Bible, in the book of Genesis, wherein we are told that God formed man out of the dust or elements of the earth, and then breathed into his nostrils, or into his physical body, the <span class="CharOverride-2">breath of life </span>or the divine essence, and man became a <span class="Italic-Basic">living soul</span>. Until such essence was breathed into his body man was lifeless and incapable of fulfilling the purpose for which he was created, and he was of no more use than an electric light bulb before the electric essence gives it light and life. The physical body of man is without divine intelligence or consciousness, and without vitality or purpose, until the soul enters it and makes it a living soul rather than a mere existing body. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We can see by these two illustrations that the soul essence and consciousness resident in each physical body is not separated from the essence and consciousness that is in <span class="Italic-Basic">every other living body</span>. If we were to think of the soul in each individual body being a <span class="Italic-Basic">separate</span> and d<span class="Italic-Basic">istinct soul</span>, independent of all the others, and not in actual contact with all others, we would have a condition similar to that shown by the letter J in the upper part of Figure 1. Here the electric lamp bulb has the electric wires within it but these are not connected with the electric circuit. We see at once that a lamp in this condition is no different from that shown by the letter B, for there is no contact between the electric wires in the bulb and those which contain the real energy. Such a lamp could not manifest light of any kind. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">By looking at the body identified as letter I at the end of the lower diagram, we see that same point illustrated by breaking the connection between the soul in the body and the universal soul essence. We see at once that such a condition is an impossibility, for the soul essence and the consciousness in a physical body must remain in contact with the <span class="Italic-Basic">source of essence</span> and the <span class="Italic-Basic">source of consciousness </span>in order to maintain its manifestation of essence and consciousness. Matter itself is not intelligent, for it is composed of the gross elements of the earth, and these elements have neither mind nor consciousness until they are organized and prepared to receive some form of consciousness. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Long ago the ancient philosophers and mystics gave a name to the universal soul and consciousness that pervades all space. This name we have modernized into the term <span class="Italic-Basic">Oversoul</span>. Some have called it the Cosmic Soul; some have called it the Divine Soul; and others the <span class="Italic-Basic">Soul of God</span>. Such other terms, however, imply that there are various kinds of souls in the universe, and that one of these is divine, or the Soul of God or of the Cosmic, whereas the others are not. But, since there is <span class="Italic-Basic">but one soul</span> in the universe, the term <span class="Italic-Basic">Oversoul</span> is preferred, because it does not attempt to distinguish this soul from any other, except to intimate that it is the soul that exists everywhere without being separated from its various manifestations in physical bodies. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Therefore, we will use the term<span class="Italic-Basic"> Oversoul</span> to mean the Universal Soul or God, or, in other words, the divine consciousness and essence of God which pervades all space,and segments of which are manifested in each human body. This means that in the body of each human being there is the soul essence, the power, the energy, the consciousness of God, that <span class="Italic-Basic">God is within u</span>s rather than without. This brings us to a clearer understanding of many of the sacred writings of the past and especially those which are found in the Christian doctrines. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In thinking of the Oversoul extending a part of itself downward and into the body of each human being, we must give some thought to the relationship of the soul to the ego and the personality of each human being, as touched upon in preceding chapters. In order to impress these relationships upon the mind of my reader I have resorted to another schematic illustration which is given here as Figure 2. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Here we have two heavy dark lines descending from above and coming down into a circular enclosure. Let us consider the two dotted circular lines in the center of the diagram as representing the physical body of man. Inside of these two dotted lines we see the heavy black lines representing the soul essence and consciousness descending from the Cosmic into the physical body. In the center of this soul we find another body, often referred to as the <span class="Italic-Basic">psychic body</span>, which is the ego or personality, and this ego is composed of the mind and memory that is associated with each segment of the Over-soul. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In other words, if we look upon the Oversoul in the universe as being divided into unbroken segments, and each segment representing a part of the Oversoul that resides in a human body, we will find that each one of these segments of the Oversoul possesses an ego or personality composed of mind or intelligence, and consciousness with memory. The soul itself is composed of the divine essence, or vital life force—creative energy which emanates from God, the source of all life. However, in addition to this creative and vitalizing energy of the soul, each segment possesses, as an attribute, an ego or personality, with its mind, memory, and consciousness. As I have stated above, this ego or personality, with its divine mind and divine consciousness, has often been referred to as the <span class="Italic-Basic">psychic body</span> of man, resident with in the physical body. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In Figure 2 you will also see the aura radiating from the physical body. This aura is like the radiations of light that come from an electric bulb when the wires within are connected with the source of electricity. The aura of the human body is the result of the soul essence and vitality resident within the physical body. I have illustrated this aura in the form of an egg or oval, inasmuch as the aura within a human body is often seen in this form, and in many ancient manuscripts the aura of man is referred to as an egg, and therefore symbolical of the reproductive energy of the animal kingdom. When the soul with its essence and consciousness is withdrawn from the physical body, the aura follows the soul and no longer manifests around the physical body. As I have stated elsewhere in this book, thousands of observations have been made at the time of transition when the aura of the physical body has been seen to rise above the body and to remain in space as the soul withdrew and left the body lifeless. </p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Fig. 2</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It is very important that the elements of Figure 2 should be carefully studied. Keep in mind that the two black lines represent the divine essence of the Oversoul descending into the physical body. The physical body is represented by the two large dotted circular lines. But, the soul in the body has also other attributes besides its divine essence and vitality. These attributes constitute the ego or personality, with mind and memory. This ego or personality <span class="Italic-Basic">always remains with each segment</span> of the Oversoul, for the ego is immortal like the soul itself, and cannot be destroyed and never ceases to exist. Whether the segment of the soul<span class="Italic-Basic"> is in the physical body or out of it,</span> the ego, with its mind, memory, and consciousness remains with it, and so we see that we can have an intelligent, conscious segment of the soul <span class="Italic-Basic">either in a body</span> or <span class="Italic-Basic">out of a body</span>. When it is in a <span class="Italic-Basic">body </span>we have the union of the spiritual with the material, making a perfect manifestation of a living soul on earth. When it is <span class="Italic-Basic">out of a body </span>we have a physical body that is lifeless, unintelligent, and unconscious, and a segment of soul still retaining its vitality and consciousness, ego, and intellect. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">With these points well fixed in your mind we will now look at Figure 3. Here I have shown a number of physical bodies with the soul segment and personality, or ego, in them A, B, C, and F represent living bodies with the soul essence and ego resident in them, and the aura of life extending around the physical body. At D, I have shown what occurs at the time of transition. Here the soul with its ego and aura is withdrawn from the physical body, leaving the body without any aura or life. At E, I have shown the complete separation, and you will notice that I have illustrated this by showing the segment of the soul still maintaining its aura and personality or ego, although having ascended into the Cosmic and no longer in contact with the physical body which is now lying into the dust of the earth, disintegrating and returning to its primary elements. </p>

					<img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="image/Fig3.jpg" alt="" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1">Fig. 3</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You will notice by studying Figure 3 that all of the egos in each segment of the Oversoul are connected and associated through the contact with the divine soul essence, and that even in the case where the soul has completely withdrawn from the body, the ego of the segment is in contact with all of the other egos through its universal contact with the Oversoul. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">So much for the illustration of the principle of the universal association and contact of all egos in all living things. This should impress us with the principle that the personality which each of us possesses throughout life, or the ego which we manifest throughout life, is not a <span class="Italic-Basic">mortal</span> thing but an <span class="Italic-Basic">immortal</span> thing, and a part of the Oversoul existing eternally. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We should also be impressed with the fact that the ego, or personality, which each of us manifests during our lifetime,continues to exist and retain its identity over after transition. Therefore, there are egos, or personalities, existing in physical bodies on the earth, and existing <span class="Italic-Basic">outside of physical bodies </span>in the Cosmic. And all of these egos, or personalities, incarnated in bodies or existing outside of bodies in the Cosmic, are in contact and constant communication with each other through having the same soul essence continuously passing through them. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Incidentally, it may be mentioned that this ancient understanding of the association of all egos with each other, and the uniting of all souls into one <span class="Italic-Basic">soul</span>, was the foundation for the belief in the<span class="Italic-Basic"> universal brotherhood of man </span>through the <span class="Italic-Basic">universal fatherhood of all beings,</span> and establishes the fact that all human beings are brothers and sisters under one creator and of the same essence, same vitality, and same consciousness, regardless of race, creed, color, or other distinctive elements of the ego. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The next important consideration is in regard to the cycles of incarnations. The question its often asked as to how many times man incarnates on earth, and when this process of development will discontinue. Mysticism, and the scientific study of this subject, gives a well-known example of <span class="Italic-Basic">perfect soul personality development, </span>whereby the need for further incarnations on earth was brought to an end. This is in the case of <span class="Italic-Basic">Jesus the Christ</span>, who, having had many previous incarnations as intimated in the Christian gospels, was finally born pure and with a personality or ego requiring only <span class="Italic-Basic">one more</span> group of experiences. At the end of these experiences, which were to demonstrate the highest principles of cosmic law and God’s will and power, <span class="Italic-Basic">Jesus the Christ </span>having attained Christhood through the highest perfection and pureness of a consciousness, ascended into heaven and was there absorbed into the consciousness of God, and the ego of Jesus became one of the divine elements of the Godhead. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Until such perfection is attained by each human being,there will be need for each personality and each ego to reincarnate <span class="Italic-Basic">again and again</span>, and through the experiences of life, through personal effort and attainment, through devotion and sacrifice, purge the ego of all evil in thought or action, and finally become pure in every point and ready for the ultimate Judgment, when it will be accepted unto God again and become a part of the Divine Godhead. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Jesus himself promised that this would be the ultimate and highest reward for all devotion and effort toward godliness. What he stated in this regard was well understood by the prophets who preceded him, but none of whom had attained the degree of perfection attained by him. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Therefore, we see that it is impossible to tell how many times each ego, or personality, must be reincarnated in physical form on the earth plane. One point, however, in regard to the cycles of reincarnation, has been determined by observation. It has been found that each ego, or personality,reincarnates on earth <span class="Italic-Basic">approximately every 144th year. </span>In other words, 144 years has been found to be the average length of time <span class="Italic-Basic">between rebirths</span>. This does not mean, however, that there can be no exception to that average. Just as there is an average length of time for human gestations, although this may vary at times, so there is an average length of time between rebirths on earth, although this, too, may vary according to circumstances. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It has been found, however, that although there is a variation in these periods of 144 years, after ten or twelve reincarnations the number of years involved in them shows that the average time is about 144 years between rebirths in infant bodies. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Nominally, man should live in his physical body 144 years,and then the soul would withdraw from that body, ascend to the Cosmic, and in a few days, or few hours, descend again into a new body. But, man by his manner of living, and his continued violation of natural laws, has gradually shortened his length of time on earth so that the average physical body reaches transition long before 144 years have passed. But since he will not be <span class="Italic-Basic">reborn again</span> until the 144 th year, there will be a period of cosmic residence for his ego, during which the ego will await the coming of the 144th year of rebirth. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In other words, if a person lived to be 100 years of age on earth, and then passed through transition, the ego would have a period of waiting in the Cosmic for 44 years until the normal time for rebirth. If a person lived to be 124 years of age on the earth, the ego would wait in the Cosmic 20 years. And a person who had lived 80 years of earthly life would reside in the Cosmic for 64 years. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">By referring to Figure 4, we will see these periods of rebirths plainly illustrated. The top line of Figure 4 shows the cycles of rebirth divided by periods of 144 years. In this top lines the double circles labeled E, represent the <span class="Italic-Basic">cycles of life on earth</span>, or, in other words, the cycles of the soul incarnated in a physical body. The small dotted circle above the line, marked with the letter S, represents the <span class="Italic-Basic">spiritual residence</span> of the ego in the Cosmic. The entire top line shows an imaginary life line of an ego that lived <span class="Italic-Basic">on earth 100 years</span> in each period, <span class="Italic-Basic">and 44 years in the Cosmic</span> in each period. Starting with the first birth <span class="Italic-Basic">on earth</span> we find that the next rebirth occurred at the 144 th year, the second at the 288 th year, the third at the 432nd year, etc. In other words, in 1152 years this personality would have passed through eight incarnations on earth and would be ready for the ninth. </p>
			<div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1">
				<div id="_idContainer011">
					<img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="image/Fig4.png" alt="" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="Centered-Basic">Fig. 4 </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Such an equal division of births and rebirths is purely imaginary, however, and probably impossible to find in actual experience. Therefore, let us consider the lower line of Figure 4. Here we have an imaginary life line of a person as we may find it in any part of the world. In this life line we soon notice that the periods of life on earth are of various lengths. Beginning at the start of the line we find that the first period on earth, indicated by the letter A, was about 90 years, leaving a period of 54 years for the personality to reside <span class="Italic-Basic">in the Cosmic</span>, as shown by the dotted line B. At the 144th year, however, the personality was reborn on earth,and this rebirth is shown by the double line marked C. This period on earth, however, was for only 50 years, and after transition the personality resided on the cosmic plane for 94 years, as shown by the dotted line D. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Then, in the 288th year, the personality was reborn, as shown by the double line E. The earthly existence this time was for 135 years and the personality then ascended to the Cosmic and resided there for 9 years, as indicated by the dotted line F. At the end of this cosmic period the personality was reborn, as shown by the double line marked G, but this time the earthly life was for only 10 years, and after transition the personality ascended into the Cosmic; but because its previous period on earth <span class="Italic-Basic">had been so short</span> the personality resided in the cosmic for only 35 years, and then was reborn, as shown by the double circle marked I. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Thus we see there were short and long periods on both the earth and cosmic planes, and the rebirths did not always occur at precisely the 144th year of the cycle. However, we notice that at the end of 1152 years this personality had passed through approximately eight incarnations on earth, just as had the imaginary one on the upper line of the diagram. Therefore, although one of these lives was not strictly according to the 144-year periods, it did average about eight incarnations to 1152 years. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">So it has been found with the average person whose incarnations have been traced through past history. Although they have not always been reborn at precisely the 144th year of the complete cycle, nevertheless taking ten, twelve, or fourteen of the past incarnations and dividing the number of years involved by the number of earthly incarnations, we find that they did average about 144 years between rebirths. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A child born today and living but a few hours, and then passing through transition, may have its ego reside in the Cosmic for the balance of 144 years or it may be reborn in ten, twenty, or fifty years. But, after a number of reincarnations the average period will be found to be 144 years. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This means that the average person living today can roughly estimate that he or she was reborn approximately each 144-year period backward through history. The rule is not exact, for there are exceptions as shown in the lines of Figure 4. Why some personalities are reborn sooner than others can only be judged by a consideration of the law of Karma. Since the purpose of the ego’s residence in the Cosmic awaiting rebirth is to be purified and instructed, and prepared for the next incarnation, we may safely judge that those who have lived a pure and nearly perfect life here on earth up to the time of transition will require a very short time of cosmic preparation before being reborn. On the other hand, those who have fallen out of grace and who have yielded to temptation and who have sinned much will probably find that they must spend the full and allotted time upon the cosmic plane in being purged and prepared for rebirth. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We seen in all of this the marvelous and beautiful justice of God’s ways, and of the uniformity of cosmic laws and principles manifested even in the cycles of life, as they are in the formation of crystals, the movement of planets, and the composition of the elements of matter. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Even man’s life on earth is divided into periods and cycles of seven years each, during which certain definite things occur in the life of everyone. By a study of these earthly cycles any man or woman can easily foresee and foretell what definite events will occur in their earthly lives, and prepare for them, and take advantage of those which are propitious or fortunate. In my book dealing with the cycles of life* on earth, all of these periods have been explained and worked out in the tables, so that each and every person can easily determine the fortunate and unfortunate periods of his earthly life and be prepared for emergencies of all kinds. Even the cycles of previous incarnations can be determined in this way, and it is possible to learn what our previous personalities and egos manifested in our last incarnation. Since all of this has been dealt with exhaustively in my other book, I will not deal with it here, for it has no definite place in the discussion of the present subject. </p>
