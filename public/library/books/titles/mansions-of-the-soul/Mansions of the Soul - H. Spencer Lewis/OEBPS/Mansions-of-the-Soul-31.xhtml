			<p class="First-Paragraph"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">I</span><span class="ALL-CAPS">t may be </span>more interesting to cover the usual objections and questions relating to the doctrines of reincarnation by selecting the principal ones from a mass of correspondence and putting the answers with them. </p>
			<p class="Triangle"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" src="image/10366.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="Bold">Question:</span> Why is it that we do not hear more about reincarnation from eminent or well-known scientists and clergymen? Does this not indicate that such persons do not approve of the doctrines? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="Bold">Answer: </span>Clergymen or others who are the accepted representatives of religious creeds or movements which do not include the doctrines of reincarnation can hardly be expected to promote such doctrines or endorse them, regardless of what their personal opinions may be. On the other hand,many eminent clergymen and scientists have endorsed the principles of the doctrines of reincarnation. Scientists, especially, have often made public statements in this regard,and so have many prominent and successful businessmen. Typical of both of these classes are Arthur Conan Doyle and Henry Ford. We must remember, however, that few people wear their religions on their sleeves and very few, indeed,desire to proclaim their personal religious or philosophical beliefs; the mere silence on the part of any person in regard to such beliefs in nowise indicates the true thoughts that may be in his mind. If you can succeed in having prominent persons tell you in confidence their personal opinions and beliefs you may be surprised at their comments. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question: </span>Why do you not publish a list of all of the prominent people or well-known thinkers who have endorsed the doctrines of reincarnation? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer: </span>Simply because such a list would be unfair unless it were nearly complete, and a complete list would make an entire volume of a large size, which few would care to read. Secondly, the doctrines of reincarnation are not offered or presented to anyone as something which should be accepted because of eminent endorsement. Many of the most notable fallacies and unsound theories which have had popular acceptance were at one time offered to the public solely through eminent scientific or ecclesiastical endorsement. Thousands have been burned at the stake or slaughtered in their homes because they refused to accept doctrines or dogmas which were eminently endorsed and promoted by the representatives of those who endorsed them. Yet, these very principles and dogmas were later found to be untrue. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Millions of persons in the past have accepted on faith the ideas and beliefs of others only to find that they were just as truly misled by such eminent endorsement as by their own judgment. The doctrines of reincarnation have not spread throughout the world to become important guides in the lives of millions through endorsement, but through the commonsense, logical reasoning on the part of the men and women who have given their own thoughts to the mysteries of life and to the analyzing of the doctrines. If your own good judgment cannot convince you of the soundness of the doctrines of reincarnation, you should not accept them on the strength of someone else’s faith in them or someone else’s endorsement of them. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question: </span>What becomes of the idea, or belief, in the resurrection of the body, if the doctrines of reincarnation are true? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer:</span> If it is true that there will come a day when all of the physical bodies in dissolution in all parts of the world will have their elements drawn together and the dust of their bones restored and the cells of the flesh reestablished into physical forms again and arise from the graves to ascend into the heavens, there is nothing in the doctrines of reincarnation to refute it. The personality or soul of a person may reincarnate a thousand times and still dwell eventually in heaven and await the resurrection of the last physical body possessed by it. Whatever is true will be made manifest,and if the doctrines of reincarnation are true they cannot be contrary to any other doctrines that are true. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question: </span>What about twins? If two bodies are born at practically the same minute, are there two segments of the soul or two personalities in the bodies, or just one? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer:</span> Physiologically and biologically the bodies of some twins are “identical ” and had their origin in one conception. The same soul personality that was intended for one body would then be divided between the two, and would reside in the two bodies, and manifest through them throughout life. This is why some twins have the same inner natures, the same tendencies, talents, and emotional characteristics even when the outer, physical countenance is slightly different. When transition comes, the soul in the bodies of such twins returns to the Cosmic as one soul personality and may or may not enter the bodies of twins again. There are records of many a person who had found in the peculiar complex nature of his personality, and in the psychic functioning of his soul, that in a previous incarnation his soul personality had been divided between two bodies of twins and had accumulated many strange experiences in life. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">When one of the twins passes through transition ahead of the other, the soul with its personality of the one that has passed on unites with the one still living. The continued contact between the two inner selves of the twins, whereby each is constantly conscious of the thoughts and emotions of the other, and often senses even injuries to the physical body of the other, or suffers similar disorders and annoyances, proves how closely related the soul personality in each of them actually is. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question:</span> What effect has suicide on the evolution of the soul? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer: </span>The willful interference with any of nature’s laws creates a karmic condition which the personality of the individual must adjust through compensation. The willful and sudden ending of human life with the arbitrary separation of the soul from the body plunges the soul personality into an abyss of darkness for many days and weeks, in which condition the personality suffers intensely and is “earthbound” for a long period. The regret for the act is keenly realized and felt by the personality throughout its entire cosmic existence, and its reincarnation is always in a body which will have to suffer certain trials and tribulations of life until it learns the error of what it has done and makes proper compensation. The idea that suicide will bring an end to any of our earthly sufferings, trials, and tribulations is the most absurd idea that man has ever held. No matter how intense may be our earthly sufferings, or how despondent we maybe, all of this is nothing as compared with the suffering that is immediately realized after transition through suicide. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question</span>: Since Jesus did not definitely proclaim his belief in reincarnation, and my church does not preach it, I cannot believe that the doctrines are true. Is not <span class="Italic-Basic">the old religion</span> of the Christian church good enough for me? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer:</span> What do you mean by the old religion? The Christian religion has been evolving and passing through stages of modification ever since Jesus first proclaimed it to his disciples. Many of the things which you hear preached in your church today, and which you have accepted during your lifetime, were unheard of and unknown in the Christian religion some centuries ago. The Christian religion is a living, evolving guide in men’s lives, and it evolves and keeps alive through man’s continued elaboration of his interpretation and understanding of that which Jesus taught. There are many things which Jesus taught his disciples which are not preached in the Christian religion because they would not apply and could not apply to our modern ways of living,and there are many things in the Christian doctrines of today which were not expounded by Jesus, nor contained in the Christian teachings, until many centuries after the ascension of Jesus. There are, undoubtedly, many principles and doctrines of your religion acceptable to you today which your great grandparents would have criticized and would have said were modernistic, man-made, and unwarranted. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You are mistaken when you think that Jesus did not show any belief in or acceptance of the doctrines of reincarnation. Your minister, or someone else, may tell you that he did not,but if you will read certain chapters of this book again and read your Bible carefully, you will find that Jesus did admit the soundness of the doctrines of reincarnation. However, if your present religion is perfectly satisfactory to you, and you can find joy and peace in knowing and accepting only some of the laws of life while you ignore and turn your back upon others which are equally important, then this is your privilege and you should not attempt to force yourself to change your attitude. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question</span>: I think it is horrifying to believe that the soul must go through all of these periods of earthly experiences,suffering, and trials. Since the soul is divine and a part of the God essence, why should it require earthly experiences to help it reach perfection? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer</span>: The fact of the matter is that the soul is here in the physical body in contact with earthly trials and tribulations,suffering an earthly existence, through the decree of God We cannot get around the fact that God has ordained this. It may be horrifying for you to think that a part of God’s consciousness is here on the earth, associated with sordid things,but as a matter of course this fact is true, and God alone is responsible for it. That being so, why should it appear horrifying that the soul and personality should have more than one opportunity to exist on earth, and perhaps have several opportunities to exist here in better circumstances and under better conditions, with more happiness and joy than maybe found in just one lifetime? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">You seem to assume that the doctrines of reincarnation are responsible for the soul of man being imprisoned in a physical body here on earth. This is not true. The doctrines of reincarnation simply attempt to explain why this divine fact was decreed by God. If you take the doctrines of reincarnation and destroy them and wipe them out of existence,you still have to explain why the consciousness or soul of God was extended into a physical body to reside here on earth and go through trials and tribulations which the soul of God would not require. If you can answer that question with a more logical doctrine than that of reincarnation, you will solve the greatest problem that has confronted thinking men and women since the dawn of civilization. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">But remember the answer given by the average clergyman that it is “the will of God and not for us to understand,” is not an answer but an evasion. We may not be able to understand all about it but we certainly understand enough to know that the divine consciousness of God was purposely projected into the physical body here on earth, and while here this divine soul of God is in contact with sorrowful and perplexing conditions. To say that we cannot understand does not wipe out of our minds the question, and does not answer your own question. A better answer must be found,and the only better one that has ever been found is in the doctrines presented in this book. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question:</span> Do you not realize that your doctrines of reincarnation do away with hell and purgatory as established in the Christian religion? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer: </span>I know this one fact, that the Christian religion did not originally contain any dogmas about hell and purgatory. I challenge you to find any place in the New Testament where Jesus has spoken about purgatory or described hell in the manner in which it is presented today in the Christian religion. Therefore, please do not try to attribute hell and purgatory to Jesus, regardless of what your clergyman may say Both of these conditions or places are additions to the Christian doctrines made long after the life of Jesus. But, again,I say if they are true, then no other truth can destroy them. If there is a hell or purgatory into which the soul and personalities of man must pass or dwell after transition, it would not in any way interfere with the rebirth of the soul and personality after these had been purged or cleansed in hell or purgatory. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question</span>: Why should we bother about the subject of reincarnation at all? Is not life just as happy without knowing about all this? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer</span>: Very likely life is just as happy for some without any knowledge as it is for those who have a great amount of knowledge. Why do you read the Bible, or go to church, or study anything about God’s laws? You will probably live just as long without such knowledge but you certainly will not be as happy. While you are in perfect health and seemingly far from the day of transition you may safely say that you have no interest in what happens after your transition,but there may come a day when you will become profoundly interested in knowing something about the future and when you will find great consolation and peace in any knowledge regarding the hereafter. Fortunately, the larger part of the world finds its joy and happiness in knowledge, and the more knowledge and the greater understanding of life and its principles, the more happiness and contentment. The more that anyone knows about the real principles of his existence here and hereafter, the more happy and successful and perfect the life of that person will be. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question</span>: I do not like the thought of coming back again in some unknown body and having to live again through all the suffering of this life. I would rather dwell in eternal peace when this life is over. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer: </span>It is not a matter of what we would like, but of what is the law. When you are born again you will come into this earthly life just as you did in your present incarnation, knowing nothing about your past existence and filled with the joy and happiness of being alive and among the living. If you are one of the unusual persons who find no joy at all in life, and find nothing in life to make it worthwhile, you are of the type that has failed to bring joy and happiness into the lives of others and you are reaping only what you have sown. You will live again whether you want to or not, and you will continue to be reborn on this earth until you make the utmost of your life and find real joy and happiness in being among the living and in accomplishing much for others. Do not think that by ignoring the laws of reincarnation and claiming that you do not believe in them that you will prevent their operation or manifestation in your life. Therefore, so long as you will be born again and will live again, is it not better that you should know something about it and prepare yourself for it? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question:</span> What determines the nature of the soul for any specific body that is to be born? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer:</span> The determining factor is Karma. A personality awaiting rebirth which has certain karmic compensations to make or certain karmic adjustments to make will be cosmically directed toward an unborn body, which, by the nature of its environment, family associations, locality, nationality, etc, will provide the opportunities for the soul personality to carry on with its Karma. A soul personality that is awaiting rebirth and which has in its make-up the talents and abilities for music or art because of previous experience in these lines, will be directed toward an unborn body that will provide the opportunities for the expression of these talents and abilities. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Let us say, for instance, that there is a soul personality in the Cosmic awaiting rebirth which should continue its musical career and become more famous or more perfect in music. It will be directed toward an unborn body, the parents of which will be inclined by their own desires and tastes to give the child further musical education and provide the opportunities for its development along this line. If, for instance, an expectant mother desires to have a child who will be famous as a musician, and throughout the prenatal period concentrates her mind upon attracting to her unborn child the soul of a musician, and the father likewise agrees with the wife that the child that comes to them will be given every opportunity to have a musical career, the Cosmic will direct toward the unborn body the soul personality of one inclined toward or partially perfected in music. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The same would be true of any other special talent or abilities. In determining into which body a soul should enter, the Cosmic takes into consideration what the soul personality will accomplish in its next incarnation and also what certain unborn bodies may provide in the way of opportunities for these karmic conditions to manifest. An unborn body about to be born in an environment of poverty, ignorance,and physical as well as material handicaps, will have directed toward it the soul personality that requires these earthly conditions, in order to learn certain lessons and to overcome and master certain conditions. The prenatal influences of the parents, and especially of the mother, have a very definite effect with the Cosmic in determining which personality or soul essence shall enter the body of the unborn. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question: </span>Has the soul any free choice in the selection of the physical vehicle for its next earthly expression? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer: </span>The soul personality dwelling in the Cosmic awaiting rebirth does not have any free choice in the selection of the body into which it is to be incarnated. It may be attracted toward certain unborn bodies by a previous relationship, a sympathetic understanding, or some other sentimental or psychic condition, but unless this attraction fits in with the cosmic scheme, such an attraction will not decide the matter at all. The greatest influence outside of the Cosmic Mind is in the influence of parents and especially that of the mother. Parents who purposely conceive of a child with the intention of providing a vehicle for a beautiful, spiritual soul, in order that a great character and personality may be incarnated on earth and accomplish great things, will undoubtedly attract to the unborn body the very kind of soul personality they have in mind. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The more holy and sacred is the relationship of human conception and the higher the ideals held by the parents for the future of the unborn body, and the more definite their visualization of the type of character they desire in the child, the more surely will the Cosmic attend to the fulfillment of their wishes. Considering that the Cosmic at all times possesses in its Oversoul thousands upon thousands of personalities awaiting rebirth, each of a distinctly different type with a distinctly different karmic future and distinctly different tendencies and abilities, it is easy to understand how the Cosmic can direct toward any unborn body the type and character of personality that the parents may desire. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question:</span> What effect upon the future child have the destructive thoughts of a mother or father who does not want a child and tries to prevent its birth? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answe</span>r: In such a case we would have a situation the very reverse of that stated above. When a mother is determined not to have a child, and from the moment of conception attempts to destroy the embryo or prevent the development and birth of the body, her mind is filled with two strong emotions. First, that of hatred and enmity toward the body that is being created and the body that is coming, and, secondly, the thought of murder and destruction. She will attract to the unborn body the soul personality that must fulfill certain karmic conditions of its own and at the same time assist in teaching the parents the error of their thoughts. Therefore, a personality that is of an unsympathetic and unkindly type, given to destructive acts, may be directed toward this unborn body, and during this child’s adolescence the parents will realize the error of their thinking and will appreciate the fact that they have reaped as they have sown,while the child itself will grow into manhood and have an opportunity of purging itself of the evil tendencies it has and be prepared for a better and more noble birth in the next incarnation. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question:</span> What effect does the education and social position of parents have upon the selection of a soul personality for their unborn child? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer:</span> Parents who are in good social position and well educated will have directed toward them, or may attract to them, the personality of a soul that requires the opportunities for karmic adjustment which social position and education will provide; or such a soul personality as must learn the lessons of life through being born into a family of affluence and suddenly find these things taken away and a life of poverty remaining. A soul personality that in a previous incarnation had bitterly hated all persons of wealth and social position would be cosmically directed to be born in a family of wealth and influence in order that it might learn that all such persons are not evil minded and unworthy of esteem. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">A soul personality that in a previous incarnation had freely and happily given away everything of its small earthly wealth to help in every possible humanitarian activity, and gladly suffered in want in order to help others, might be cosmically directed in the next incarnation to a body born in an environment of wealth so that it could continue to do its humanitarian work without limitation. If, in this new incarnation, it failed to continue to do the good it had done when living in want, it would not be born again in wealth, but after having had an opportunity to distribute wealth to the needy and having applied it selfishly, it would be born in its next incarnation in an environment of poverty or want in order to be impressed once again with certain values and conditions of life. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question: </span>Is it possible for an expectant mother to attract to her unborn child the soul personality of a child she had earlier in her life and which was taken away through transition? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer: </span>This is possible, although the mother might not know for many years that she had succeeded in attracting the same soul personality for a second time. There are instances on record where a mother has finally recognized in her second child the character and personality of a child that she had many years before and which passed through transition at the age of twelve or fifteen. Such instances, of course, require a short period on the cosmic plane between births and are an exception to the general cycle of rebirth,but for some cosmic reason the exception is made. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question: </span>Do the thoughts of the mother during the prenatal period have any effect upon not only the personality of the soul that is to come to the child, but upon the child’s physical body and sex? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer</span>: If the prenatal influences of the mother begin soon enough after conception, or really start at the time of conception, it is possible for these thoughts of the mother and father to determine the sex and the general physiological characteristics of the future child as well as the spiritual characteristics. The Greeks were famous for their knowledge and efficiency in the application of such knowledge along this line, but the art of prenatalism has almost become lost. There are some organizations in the world, including the Rosicrucians, who retain and promulgate private instructions and knowledge regarding this subject. The degree of success attained through prenatal wishes depends upon the efficiency of the methods used by the parents and the use of the proper degree of concentration. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question:</span> Is there any tendency upon the part of the Cosmic to continue the incarnation of certain soul personalities in the same family lines of generation? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer: </span>Nothing has been found in any of the tests and revelations connected with research on this subject indicating that this is so. After a soul personality enters the Cosmic through transition it loses all of its association and connection with its physiological or material, earthly relations. Family blood and family trees are matters of the physical body and not of the soul personality, and in the Cosmic there are no such things as physical, earthly relationships. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question:</span> What is meant by “carrying over ” something from a previous incarnation? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer: </span>Usually it is said that when a person manifests early in this life some very distinct tastes or tendencies or dislikes and repulsions, he has carried these things over from a previous existence. It is also said that persons who have a fear of the water, or of fire, or sharp instruments, or of certain locations or positions, have also carried these things over from the past. It has been found that many of the strongest likes and dislikes in our present personality, and especially those which manifest themselves in our childhood or youth, are the outstanding points of our personality in its last incarnation, and that these things had such a dominant place in our life that they easily rise now from the memory of the secondary personality and have become parts of our present character. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question:</span> Is it true that the things which we were most concerned about during the last hours of our life in a previous existence become dominating factors in our thinking and acting in the present existence? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer:</span> From very careful investigations which have been made it has been quite conclusively proved that those thoughts which occupied our minds most strongly, and with profound concern, during the last conscious moments before transition in a previous existence will become guideposts to our thinking in the present incarnation. A man or woman whose last conscious thoughts were centered around regrets for having performed or committed some sin or act of injury to another, and whose last conscious thinking was concerned with a desire to be able to undo or make recompense and compensation for these acts, will undoubtedly carry into the next incarnation the unquenchable desire to do something for those who are found in similar predicaments. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As a hypothetical example let us say that a person in his last hours regretted the fact that he had at some time in his life performed an injustice against a widow with two children by robbing them of their rightful inheritance, and he desired above all things that he might live a few hours longer and make recompense and undo the wrong he did. If this all-absorbing desire was still in his mind when transition came, it would be so registered in the consciousness of his personality that in the next incarnation it would be uppermost in all of his inward reflections or passive meditations. It would seem then as a strange and unquenchable desire to locate widows with children or persons in similar conditions who were in great want, or who were in serious predicaments through the wrongs of another, and try to alleviate their suffering or do something to help them in adjusting their affairs. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This desire might manifest early in childhood or youth in the form of a sympathetic emotion which would rise uncontrollably whenever the story or facts of such a situation were brought before him, and even though this person later on attained only moderate circumstances in life he would be found at various times attempting in some way to help those of this class who were in such situations. This explains why many persons, even those who are living a life or evil or crime, often have deep-seated emotional tendencies of a charitable or humanitarian nature. Very often these persons look upon such tendencies in their nature as weaknesses, and they frankly admit that there is a “baby ” nature within them which they cannot restrict and correct,and which cries and is moved by certain forms of sorrows or wrongs in life. Many of our strongest emotions or impulses toward human conditions and relationships, which were discovered in our nature early in life, are unquestionably carried over from the past. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question: </span>Is it possible that a person who lived a life of crime and who always sought an opportunity to injure others, and who passed through transition suddenly in the height of his ambitions for crime, would “carry over ” into the next incarnation these tendencies and desires to do wrong and injury? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer:</span> The purpose of the soul’s temporary residence in the cosmic realm between incarnations is for the cleansing and purification of the evil tendencies in the personality. A person whose transition occurred in the very height of crime activity, with the personality held in the ambition of crime,would not come into life again with these same tendencies. Before his rebirth his personality would not only have been purged of these evil desires and tendencies, but the suffering through regret, and the lessons learned while in the cosmic realm, would have taught the personality the error of such thinking and would have substituted the desire to live properly. There would still remain, however, the karmic debt to make compensation for the crimes previously committed. Therefore, such a person would be born again with no desires to do evil, but rather with strong desires to live properly. Nevertheless, the need to pay the karmic debt would force this person to pass through many forms of suffering, injury, and sorrow at the hands of others similar to that caused in the lives of other persons in his previous existence. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">This person now attempting to live correctly and being free entirely from any evil thoughts or evil desires and ambitions, always doing what was right, would nevertheless find himself suffering and in sorrow as though he had actually committed many crimes and many evil acts in his present life. This is why so many persons who are truly trying to live a good life, and who are really idealistic in their desires and plans for living, wonder why they are often plunged into sorrow, want, and misery like unto those who are now living lives of evil and crime. They say, “I am trying to do my best, living the best I know how, doing no injury to anyone, and yet every now and then I am reduced to want, denied those things I desire the most, and made to suffer like those who do evil. Does it pay, therefore, to live rightly and think rightly when one has to suffer like those who live wrongly?” </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">If these persons understood that the sorrow and misery in their lives is the adjustment that they are making for the past, and thereby cleansing the spirit and making it wholesome for a future life of happiness, and by their present attempts to live correctly they are guaranteeing a life of joy and abundance in the future, they would not become so discouraged and would not be puzzled by the seeming paradoxes of life. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question:</span> Why is it that so many persons who are living in evil ways and actually doing wrong unto others seem to be so happy and enjoy not only all the necessities and many of the luxuries of life, but apparently escape all punishment here and all detection in their evil ways? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer: </span>First, let me say that in most cases we make serious errors in our judgment of the success, happiness, and prosperity of persons who are engaged in crime or evil living. From our distant or external point of view it may seem that these persons are happy, or prospering in their crimes and avoiding dedication and punishment. The fact that the Cosmic is conscious of our wrongs, however, and that they are not escaping cosmic detection and inevitable punishment, shows how we may be mistaken in thinking that human detection has been evaded. Most certainly we may be greatly mistaken in believing that these persons are prospering in financial, social, or other ways through their crimes,for it is a fact that very few criminals, even those who have in the height of their careers obtained enormous fortunes of worldly possessions, have ever passed away in even moderate worldly circumstances; and usually the close of their lives finds them in abject poverty and want, along with social rejection and the scorn of their companions. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The average criminal who has eventually found redemption through his own thinking, or through religion or personal help and guidance, has admitted that in dollars and cents paid to avoid detection and cover the crimes or secure legal advice, and to escape the revenge of his blackmailing associates, and in hours of worry, hiding, mental torment,and inner condemnation, it had cost him more than he ever secured through his crime. The criminal’s prosperity of today, or of this month or year, may be his karmic load of tomorrow or the following year. His outward appearance of enjoying the things of life may be the coating of veneer which he must assume in order to escape public detection. Neither you nor I can ever tell what such a person suffers in the privacy of his own life. But, even though the person who lives in evil should prosper in the material things of life,there is no question about the <span class="Italic-Basic">inevitable price</span> that he must pay and suffer in the purging process during the cosmic period and in the karmic compensation process in his next life among other mortals. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It is only our man-made process of punishing a criminal or evildoer here and now, and in like manner unto his crime, that makes us think that those who are continuing in evil without <span class="Italic-Basic">immediate</span> punishment are escaping punishment altogether. As stated elsewhere in this book, the cosmic laws of compensation do not seek to punish a man on a basis of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, nor to revengefully make man suffer for his evildoing, but seek to bring about such reactions for his crime as will sometime, in some manner, most propitiously and efficiently cause him to realize the error of his ways and aid him to correct them, and give him an opportunity to compensate for them and otherwise find redemption and salvation. The keynote to the cosmic law of Karma is <span class="Italic-Basic">regeneration</span> rather than <span class="Italic-Basic">punishment. </span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question:</span> Is it true that when a person is under the influence of a powerful drug and is in a deep unconscious state,the soul leaves the body and wanders about in space and may not return? Is it also true that in such circumstances the soul of some person also wandering in space may comeback into the wrong body? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer: </span>Both of these questions can be easily and quickly cast aside with the explanation that the soul never leaves the physical body and breaks its contact with the body except at“death” or transition. That being true, the other fanciful beliefs regarding the soul wandering in space and getting lost are seen to be absurdities. The only difference between the state called <span class="Italic-Basic">death</span> and the deep sleep or a trance condition is the separation of soul and body. When this separation takes place and the soul is no longer in contact with its body, we have the unique condition called <span class="Italic-Basic">transition </span>or <span class="Italic-Basic">death</span>. There is no other condition precisely like it. A person, therefore, must be either living or non-living so far as the soul in the body is concerned. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">What occurs during the period of sleep or unconsciousness through drugs of any kind is of a purely psychological nature and has very little to do with the soul. The state is primarily physiological with its related effect upon the psychic conditions. The soul does not wander in space at such times but remains in the body. The ego may extend itself and its consciousness may appear to wander in space by making wide and various contacts through its extension, but it never becomes separated from the body. Furthermore,there are no souls wandering in space to become lost, and there is no such thing as a lost soul slipping back into a body to which it has not been cosmically assigned. These sorts of ideas are examples of the strange teachings issued by some mystical schools and are limited only by the daydreams and imagination of the authors of such teachings. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question: </span>Are there any reports on record of persons who have been on the borderline of transition and returned to life to explain any strange experiences? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer: </span>Yes, there are many such reports and the only evidential value that lies in these reports is the similarity of statements made by persons in various parts of the world who had no way of knowing what others had reported in similar circumstances. A typical case of this kind is that of a young man of twenty-four who suffered a relapse after an operation in a hospital,and for several days continued to sink in vitality and consciousness until the doctor and nurses were waiting the ultimate transition. One afternoon, at a little after two o’clock, when two nurses, a physician, and four friends were seated around the bedside of the semiconscious patient, he suddenly relaxed and gave every indication of having passed into the so-called death state. As the nurses proceeded to cover the body and arrange the hands and arms in a proper position, all in the semi lighted room were surprised to see a white haze float upward from the body for a few feet, and then assume a vertical position and descend, to remain over in one of the corners of the bedroom. Everyone rose to his feet and stood spellbound, silent, and reverential. Not a word was spoken for a full long minute. Then the physician recommended that the body be removed from the room for the usual care given to the dead. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">As the nurses again attempted to touch the physical body,the misty haze in the corner of the room trembled or shook violently so that its light waves seemed to undulate in a peculiar manner. This action was so definite that everyone in the room except the physician suggested that the body be left on the bed for a while and that tests be made to see whether “death” had actually occurred. Every scientific test was made during the next fifteen minutes and the nurses agreed with the physician that there was no possibility of life in the body. Again, however, the strange misty haze in the corner of the room, which was almost six feet in height and about the width of a human body, trembled and seemed agitated by the attempt to remove the body from the bed. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">One of the friends present—who was a student of the Rosicrucian teachings and well versed in these matters—suggested that the room be darkened by drawing down the shades at the windows and closing the door for a few minutes in order to see if the misty light or haze in the corner of the room had any real significance. The physician agreed with some reluctance and all the persons in the room stood in a corner opposite to the misty haze, so as to have a better view of it. As the eyes become accustomed to the darkness of the room it was noticed that a very thin and hovering cord or beam of hazy light seemed to stretch across the bed and unite the misty haze in the corner with the physical body on the bed. This was definitely seen even by the physician and the nurses, who agreed that it was an unusual sight. It was suggested then that this might indicate that consciousness had not entirely left the body and that there was still some life in it. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The idea was proposed then that all remain seated for awhile and see if there was any development of a significant nature. The physician explained that if the body was lifeless, minutes should not be lost in performing the usual preparations upon the body in making it ready for burial. Of course, this meant the draining of the fluids from the body and the injection of the embalming fluids. At each suggestion that this be done, the misty haze in the corner became agitated as though protesting against the suggestion. It was this possibility that gradually dawned upon the consciousness of those assembled, for it did appear that each time the approach was made to the body to remove it, there was a reaction as of protest on the part of the misty haze. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">After about twenty more minutes had passed, those assembled in the room became conscious of the fact that the thin beam of light that united the body with the haze in the corner was widening or becoming thicker or more brilliant. At first, this was attributed to the adjustment of the eyes to the darkness of the room, but soon it was noticed that the misty haze in the corner was being absorbed into the beam and that in this manner the whole hazy figure in the corner of the room was being drawn toward the physical body on the bed. In what was considered to be about four minutes, the entire misty haze in the corner had disappeared and was hovering over the physical body and was gradually beginning to lower itself into the physical form. In another two or three minutes, there was no indication of the misty haze in any part of the room. The shades at the windows were lifted and in the soft light of the room further tests were made of the physical body. Indications of life or vitality were then discovered, and immediately methods were used to restore or strengthen the vitality to its greatest degree. Ina little less than an hour breathing started, and there was a return of temperature to parts of the body. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">By seven o’clock that evening, with the same nurses and visiting friends still in attendance and with only an absence of one hour on the part of the physician, the young man regained consciousness sufficiently to open his eyes and to announce that he was “all right” Three other physicians and several nurses of the staff were invited to the room to watch the procedure. The young man regained consciousness sufficiently to sit up in bed before ten o’clock in the evening, and to make a few comments. His only statement at that time was that he had been outside of his body and had watched the whole procedure in the room, but knew that he was still connected in a strange way with the physical body on the bed and that he had done his out most to prevent them from doing anything that would have severed that connection. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The next day, he told his story of how he had passed through a strange change whereby his consciousness or his real self with which he did his thinking and realizing had floated out of his body and remained in the corner of the room, being pushed to that corner by some peculiar emanations of the physical bodies of those present and yet held fast to his own physical body by an extension of consciousness, or something that enabled him to feel every touch made on the physical body that was lying on the bed. He said that his first desire was to keep on going off into space, for he heard beautiful music, saw endless spaces of clouds with brilliant lights, and saw many forms like his own with emanations of peace and happiness. He said that this temptation to go off into space and not return to the physical body was checked only by the strange pull toward the physical form and that every time the nurses laid their hands on his physical body or attempted to move it in its position, it gave him a shock like an electric shock. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The hundreds of other things that he described later on coincided with similar statements made by others who had passed through the same experience in various parts of the world. These experiences have no place in this book, since they deal with purely personal impressions and cannot be verified except by those who have passed through similar experiences. The only positive evidence that can be extracted from such experiences is that which the nurses, physician,and friends saw with their own eyes, and from the fact that the body had been found to be so lifeless that no life would register on the most delicate instruments, and yet in less than eight hours afterwards, the man was alive again and able to sit up and talk. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question: </span>Is it true that in the so-called spiritualistic seances held in darkened rooms the souls of departed persons return to earth and clothe themselves with a material form of such a nature that no physiological difference can be found between these materialized souls and an actual, earthly,physical body? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer:</span> It is an absolute fact that the soul of an individual does not return to earth except to reincarnate again, and therefore does not float around in space and visit seance rooms,or psychic laboratories or research circles at any time. It is also an absolute fact that the soul cannot take on mortality,or physical form, except through incarnation in a physical body in the form of an infant. To explain what <span class="Italic-Basic">apparently</span> takes place in a seance room and what <span class="Italic-Basic">actually</span> takes place would require a large volume. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">It is possible for the consciousness of a departed soul to project its mentality to a distant place on earth, just as the consciousness or mentality of a person living on earth can project itself to a distant point and make itself sensed by those who may be properly attuned to receive such impressions. But this is not a projection of the soul, nor is it a materialization of the soul, as the students of spiritualistic phenomena claim through their misunderstanding of the real principles involved. I do not mean to say that certain things do not occur in a seance room, which will give the impression of a materialized soul, but I do mean to say that it is not what they believe it to be and, therefore, not what they claim it to be. The soul does not materialize itself, and it does not become clothed with a physical form except through incarnation. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Question:</span> Is it true that the most intimate contacts made with departed souls are those which are made in the privacy of one’s own home or in private circumstances, rather than in general seances or research assemblies? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-4">Answer: </span>This is absolutely true and it explains why groups of scientists, proceeding to investigate psychic phenomena in a materialistic, cold scientific manner, do not have the experiences and the convincing results that have been experienced by millions of persons in the privacy of their own home, or when alone, and in proper mental, spiritual, and psychic circumstances. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We may well understand that if it is possible for a love done, who has departed, to project his or her mental consciousness to the earth plane in order to communicate some consoling thoughts or spiritual knowledge of a personal nature, it would be done preferably in circumstances that are reverential and personal rather than in circumstances of a public or scientific nature. It is also true that the one most concerned here on earth in such an experience and who desires such a spiritual contact must, through reverential sacredness and spiritual attunement, lift up the consciousness part way to meet the consciousness that is being projected toward the earth. It is this mutual attunement of a truly sacred nature that makes possible the many thousands of personal, private, intimate contacts never duplicated in public,or scientific laboratories, or seances. Rosicrucians and others well versed in the true spiritual and cosmic laws of the universe, and knowing man’s spiritual and cosmic qualifications, attune themselves through study and experiment to make such contacts easily and efficiently. </p>
