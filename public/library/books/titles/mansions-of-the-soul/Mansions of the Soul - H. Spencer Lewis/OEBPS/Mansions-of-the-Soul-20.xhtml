			<p id="_idParaDest-12" class="Chapter-Title"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"></a>THE RELIGIOUS AND BIBLICAL VIEWPOINT </p>
			<p class="First-Paragraph"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">T</span><span class="ALL-CAPS">hose who hesitate </span>to accept the doctrines of reincarnation generally claim that no support for such doctrines can be found in any of the Western world religions. Those who are of the Christian denomination are especially positive in their statements that the Christian Bible, and the Christian doctrines as propounded by Jesus, contain no references to reincarnation and no statements which even tolerate, let alone support, the idea of reincarnation. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">These persons argue that because some of the modern religions in the Western world, representing only a minority of the religious thought of the entire world, contain no support of the doctrine of reincarnation, that it should be rejected. In their minds the modern religions are the standard by which all others are to be gauged, and the beliefs of the minority are to supplant the beliefs of the majority. Such an attitude is a continuation of the ancient attitude of intolerance toward the truths held by others, and we are happy to find that in recent years the average person of the Western world is no longer inclined to be bound by the doctrines and beliefs of his forebears, but seeks knowledge and truth, regardless of its antiquity, its origin, or the fact that it may be incompatible with the creeds and dogmas of a minority of the Western civilization. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Fortunately, however, the belief that the religions of the Western world, and the Christian Bible, give no support to the doctrines of reincarnation is disproved by a careful analysis of available sources of indisputable information. Those who have heretofore held to the belief that the Occidental religions and those which constitute the religions of Western civilization contain no reference to reincarnation will be surprised by the facts I am about to give. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Before proceeding to quote from the standard versions of the Christian Bible, I feel that it is proper to explain why the doctrine of reincarnation is not generally recognized in the Western world as an almost universal religious belief. The two great religions of the Western world today are the Jewish and the Christian. The latter is fundamentally an outgrowth of the former. There are many eminent scriptural and religious authorities who claim that many of the theological principles of Christianity are founded upon mystical principles contained in the Oriental religious philosophies We are safe in saying, however, that except for those new and unique doctrines taught by Jesus, the greater part of the Christian religion is similar to the Jewish religion, and in the Jewish religion one may trace very easily many principles of Oriental philosophies, which were found to be sound and useful, and which were retained by the Christian church during the processes of evolving the present-day Christian religion. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Before one can thoroughly understand all of the passages in the Christian Bible, as we find them in the standard versions, one must have some understanding of the religious beliefs which were universally accepted by the Jewish people at the time of the public preachings of Jesus. Many of the passages in the New Testament, and many of the references by Jesus to conditions existing around him, are not understandable unless one is familiar with the customs, habits, beliefs, and general philosophy of the people of his time. The passages in the New Testament referring to marriage and to the separation of the classes of people, and to the methods of praying, or the giving away of worldly things in order to become humble, are not fully appreciated by the Bible student, unless he is familiar with the customs, habits, and beliefs of the Jewish race at the time these allegorical or moral and ethical statements were made. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The moment the student of the Jewish religion and Jewish history becomes acquainted with the customs and habits of the people at the time of Christ’s mission, he realizes that there are many interesting facts connected with the life of the people and their beliefs and general practices not elaborated upon in either the Old or New Testaments of the Bible,because they were so commonplace and so generally accepted and acknowledged that the writers of the Bible did not feel that it was necessary to comment upon them. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">In many places in the Bible reference is made to stoning a person to death. No explanation is offered by any of the writers of the Bible as to why this method of punishment was universal in Palestine, for the writers probably believed that in their day when these facts were written, everyone was familiar with the history and universal nature of such a process. When one comes to study the history of Palestine and is fortunate enough to visit the country and live among the people for a while, one comes to realize that because of the abundance of small stones or rocks everywhere and the ease with which a multitude or a mob assembled at almost any place could reach down and quickly seize many rocks to throw at a person, that it was only natural for the mob practice of throwing stones to become a popular method. There are other references in the Bible to time of the day, periods of the year, seasons, climatic conditions, social practices, personal customs about the home, and other intimate facts which are not elaborated upon or explained in detail for the same reason. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Many of the important details about the crucifixion of Jesus the Christ are not given in the various accounts found in the New Testament simply because at the time that these accounts were written, the authors knew that the populace was familiar with such details and there was no reason for elaborating upon them in their accounts and, therefore, they dealt in detail with those points which were unique in connection with this historical event. For instance, the precise shape of the cross, the manner in which it was made, the manner in which the body was attached, and the manner in which the cross was erected, are points which were so familiar to everyone that comment upon them seemed unnecessary. There are thousands of similar voids of detail throughout the Bible which today are of great importance. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Because certain facts are not elaborated upon in the Bible is no reason for the student to believe that they did not exist or were not known to the mass of people. It may be safe to argue that since we find no reference in many ancient works to ice, that this form of frozen water was then unknown to the people of Palestine or elsewhere. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Historical research and scientific knowledge support our conclusion that ice may not have been known to the mass of people at that time in the sense we understand “ice” today. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">But to argue that the art of dentistry was unknown because there is no reference in the Bible to artificial or false teeth is to make a serious mistake, inasmuch as research has proved that among the early Egyptians the art of dentistry was known, and many mummies have been found with artificial teeth. Likewise, no one should argue that no scientific or hygienic attention was given to childbirth simply because there is no reference to it to be found in the Bible, and because the most important birth recorded therein lacks any details regarding the attention given to the mother and child. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">We now know that there were hospices for the care of mothers at delivery and that even the poor had attention voluntarily given by midwives or those who were capable of assisting at such a time. Because the details in this regard are lacking in connection with the birth of Jesus, it is not right to assume that Mary and Jesus had no hygiene or other professional attention. The authors of the story of the birth were not concerned with the facts that were commonly recognized as prevalent and general, but with those facts that were unique and of distinct importance. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The doctrine of reincarnation was generally accepted and universally established among the philosophers and mystics of the Jewish people at the time of the birth of Jesus and throughout his entire life, as we shall see in passages to be quoted. But this doctrine was not a purely religious one anymore than the doctrine or principles associated with the conception of human life, and the birth of the human body, or the principles connected with the preparation of food, the curing of disease, or the preparation of the body for burial. Such commonly accepted and generally known principles were looked upon by the writers of the Bible as universal knowledge and had no more place in the scriptural writings than had the details of the planting of seeds in the ground for crops or the weaving of cotton into cloth, the sewing of costumes, the making of shoes, or the thousand and one other things that were part of the general knowledge, practice, and customs of the day. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are many references, however, in the Christian Bible to the doctrine of reincarnation, which are positive, definite, and unquestionable, but they are associated with other statements in such a casual way that the average reader of the Bible overlooks them. This I will show later on where such passages are quoted. To prove, however, how universal was the belief in reincarnation among the Jewish people and among the disciples of Jesus, and even with Jesus himself, I am going to outline here some of the principal points in connection with reincarnation as held by the Jewish people during the Christian era. The same beliefs were also held by the people in the Oriental lands, but since the Christian and other present-day Western religions evolved out of the Jewish religion, we will limit ourselves to the presentation of the doctrines of reincarnation as known to and taught by the Jewish teachers. It is probably the first time that this information has been completely revealed in the Western world in connection with the subject of reincarnation. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">I believe that I can do no better than quote from the precise words written within recent years by Moses Gaster, PhD, Chief Rabbi of the Jewish Congregation of London,and Vice-President of the Royal Asiatic Society, who is a widely recognized author on various subjects of Jewish religion, belief, and practice. The following paragraphs are condensations of his writings without comment. Remember that this eminent authority is referring wholly to Jewish beliefs and religious practices, and that he is quoting from such standard Jewish sacred books as the Zohar, the Manasseh ben Israel, and others. </p>
			<p class="Triangle"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" src="image/10362.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The belief in the migration (or reincarnation) of the soul presupposes the existence of the soul; and a whole Esoteric system about the creation of the soul, and the conception of sin and redemption, are the fundamental principles upon which such a doctrine must rest. God is the creator of everything; therefore, souls are His creation. His creation came to an end with the close of the sixth day. At the beginning,the souls were created. The power of God is thus limited to what He had done on that occasion. The souls created, then, are of a limited number, as the creation was only a limited act, and had to come to an end at a definite period of time. These souls are God’s creation, not any emanation from God. They are conceived as having an individual existence; they live separately and fully conscious of their individuality;they dwell in the heavenly halls or in paradise in rapt contemplation of the divine glory; thither they are allowed to return at the end of their peregrination through the lower world. The souls of the born and the unborn, of those who have already been in the earth world and of those who have not yet been in that world, are dwelling together in the heavenly halls or in the treasury of God (see Deuteronomy 32:34). </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Moses in his ascent to heaven saw the souls of the great and pious and of those who have lived upon earth and of those who are to come to life hereafter—among others David and Aqiba. No new souls are created for each child that is born, the number of souls being limited. Man must by his actions approach the Divine, and his whole life must be along sustained hymn of praise to God. But man, made of the dust of the earth, cannot rise to such perfection unless the Divine Soul lifts him up, and unless the Divine Law guides him steadily upward towards heaven. His life is a constant struggle between the grossly material inclinations inherent in his earthly nature and the high spiritual promptings of his Divine Soul. According to the way in which he inclines, his soul will become more or less contaminated by the contact with matter; it will lose more and more of its spiritual luster and purity. For man has absolute free will; he is master over his own actions. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The souls have been created for a specific use; they must enter human bodies; but the choice is not left to them, either of the bodies to be selected or of the time of entry, and the time and manner of exit. Although the soul forgets most of its spiritual existence when it enters into a body in the earth world, yet a dim recollection remains, a subconscious image, which is the guiding principle in elementary recognition of good and evil. Thus every man has within himself a standard of right and wrong given to his soul in its pre-mundane existence. In the Zohar the incarnation of the soul is described in the following manner: All souls were created at the beginning of all creation; when not incarnated in bodies they dwell in heavenly bliss and divine illumination. When a body is being prepared to receive a soul, a soul requiring special earthly experience is directed or attracted to such a body as will provide such experience and knowledge. The law says unto the soul: “Ye shall see how the Lord has mercy on you. He has given you His precious </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Now the soul begins it course upon earth. It must endeavor to obtain the absolute mastery over the body and not to become its slave. In the first entry, the soul is absolutely pure and without blemish. It is not met by the obstacle of original sin. The principle upheld always is that “Each man dieth by his own sin, but the weakness inherent in matter” soon makes itself felt, and there are temptations placed in its way through the envy and spite of evil minds, which are anxious to drag it down to their own level. Through trial and trouble, man must win the crown of eternal bliss. A term is set for man’s redemption. When all souls have thus become purified through successive reincarnations and have attained the ultimate goal of perfection, the kingdom of heaven upon earth will then be established. The evil in the world strives in vain to impede the steady development and unfolding of the evolving and purifying souls. The evil may delay the development of souls, but cannot indefinitely frustrate it. The soul, which has been contaminated through earthly experiences, can be purified again; the sins committed can be atoned for through compensation and even here the means is given to the soul to achieve its own purification. The soul retains its own consciousness and is sensible to its own failings; it realizes the bitterness of punishment and the tragedy of not being allowed to ascend on high and stand before God in its Pristine purity. After transition, it remains in an intermediate state of the spiritual world waiting an opportunity to purify itself and compensate for its sins. This comes to it by being re-embodied or reborn, and thus the soul migrates from one body to another. It may or may not remember in each incarnation its former existence. Such migration continues until all the blemish has been eliminated. Such migration of souls is made to serve another and still higher and more direct purpose—the Justice of God. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The great problem which has haunted every form of religious belief has been: how to reconcile the happiness of the sinner and trials and sufferings of the pious and good with the justice of God. Every religion has endeavored to establish a doctrine which would answer this question. Some of them have relegated the solution of this problem to a continued life after death, whereby the soul remains in combination with a physical body in order that the latter may suffer the torment of hell. Such an explanation was after all a subtle way out of a difficulty and it is not quite free from a possible reproach of selfishness. Not so with the belief in the reincarnation of the soul. Here, upon earth, in the sight of all, the sinner —whosoever he might be —has to expiate his sins. Here he has to suffer for the wrongs committed,and here obtain, as it were, a pass for the heavenly regions. By this slow process of purification in successive reincarnations the whole world would benefit and the general progress and welfare of mankind would be hastened. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are, as it were, successive incarnations for each pre-existing soul, and for their sakes the world was created Simon Magus put forth the claim of former existence, his soul passing through many bodies before reaching that known as Simon. The Samaritan doctrine of the <span class="Italic-Basic">Taheb</span> teaches the same doctrine of a pre-existing soul, one of which was given to Adama, but which through successive incarnations in Seth, Noah, and Abraham, reached Moses. The doctrines further taught that not only is the world perfected by the rebirths of souls but each sinner gradually expiates his sin in this world in the new existences in which his soul reappears. The sinner’s soul may enter the body of a pious man, and by his good deeds, he will cleanse the dross, still adhering to the soul, and facilitate its ascent on high. If a truly pious person suffers, it is only and solely because of sins committed in a previous incarnation and his suffering is not a punishment for sins <span class="Italic-Basic">now</span> committed but a form of purgatory for evil deeds in a <span class="Italic-Basic">former </span>life. Likewise the sinner benefits from the good deeds that he has performed in a previous existence whereby he may prosper now for a while,but if he continues to sin, he will absorb all of the good benefits from his past life and bring upon him suffering and punishment here or in his next incarnation. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">There is a difference of opinion as to how many times a soul will reincarnate before it has attained perfection. It is generally believed that the full cycle of reincarnations is that in which the soul has performed the whole of the 613 commandments of the Law, by which alone perfection is attained by means of reincarnation the soul fulfills the object of its creation—to pass through human existences on earth and to lift man higher and to bring him nearer the Divine. This doctrine, being a justification of God’s ways with men, is,at the same time, a source of comfort to the pious, and a source of terror to the sinner. It reconciles man to suffering and trial, and at the same time explains the hidden meaning of many a law and ceremony which seems obscure. </p>
			<p class="Triangle"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" src="image/10364.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The foregoing gives us an excellent idea of the general beliefs regarding the soul and its purpose in the world as popularly held by the mass of people in all of the Oriental countries. These beliefs were firmly fixed in the minds of the majority of men and women during the lifetime of Jesus and this being the case, we can understand better the many references made to this doctrine in the Christian Bible. In a later chapter I will refer to some of the specific points outlined in the foregoing picture of Jewish beliefs. </p>
