Some of these enlightened personalities were honored during their lifetimes as great statesmen, scientists, and educators, while others, forced by circumstances to work at menial tasks, stole precious moments to write down the knowledge they received through the influx of Cosmic Illumination. Many of these courageous thinkers struggled against persecution by dogmatic, narrow-minded authorities, suffering poverty, imprisonment, and death through their efforts to bring the light of truth to the world. Among the fifty-eight featured individuals are: Herodotus, Sir Francis Bacon, Lao Tse, Jacob Boehme, Nicholas Copernicus, Socrates, Paracelsus, Rene Descartes, Sir Isaac Newton, Benjamin Franklin, Elbert Hubbard, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Albert Einstein.</p>]]></discription>
