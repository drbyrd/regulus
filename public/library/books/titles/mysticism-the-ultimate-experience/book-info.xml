        <discription><![CDATA[<p>An experience is more than just a sensation, a feeling. It is an awareness, or perception, with meaning. Our experiences are infinite in number, yet they are limited to certain types. Some are related to our objective senses; others, to dreams and inspirational ideas. But there is one that transcends them allâ€” the mystical experience. It serves every category of our being: it stimulates, it enlightens, it strengthens; it is the Ultimate Experience.
<br><br>
 In this book, Mysticism: The Ultimate Experience, Cecil Poole, former Board Director of AMORC, explores the inner experience of mysticism and defines it in simple and inspiring terms.</p>]]></discription>
