			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The Rosicrucian Order, AMORC, is a philosophical and initiatic tradition. As students progress in their studies, they are initiated into the next level or degree.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">Rosicrucians are men and women around the world who study the laws of nature in order to live in harmony with them. Individuals study the Rosicrucian lessons in the privacy of their own homes on subjects such as the nature of the soul, developing intuition, classical Greek philosophy, energy centers in the body, and self-healing techniques.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph">The Rosicrucian tradition encourages each student to discover the wisdom, compassion, strength, and peace that already reside within each of us.</p>
