                <a href="/"><h5>A Thousand Years of Yesterdays</h5></a>
                <hr>
                <p>ONE MAY OR may not believe in the strange theories of
continuous existence of personality, and one may reject the
more or less unscientific theories regarding the probability
of reincarnation, but one cannot reject with the same absoluteness the
apparent completeness of memory’s records. Almost every one has
experienced the sudden conscious realization of facts released from
the storehouse of the memory involving incidents long forgotten in
the conscious recollection; and coupled with the release of such facts
as one knows were stored away within the present span of earthy life,
there comes an array of incidents, associated and unassociated, which
could not have been stored in the memory through any experience in
this life</p>
                <p>Psychology offers as an explanation for the possession of such
seemingly inexperienced facts, the theory that in our dreams we charge
our minds with experiences which are not consciously realized at
the time or possibly forgotten in our waking state, but which return
to consciousness by association of ideas. Another theory offered
attempts to explain the mass of inexperienced incidents and ideas as
come from the subconscious mind, as being the result of the processes
of imagination.</p>
                <p class="indent">Shakespeare wrote:
                  <br>
And as imagination bodies forth
<br>
The Form of things unknown—the poet’s pen
<br>
Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing
<br>
A local habitation and a name.</p>
                <p>But, such theories leave the cause and nature of dreams and
imagination unexplained. To conceive of the mind mechanically creating
from nothing those wondrous things which the imagination of man has
given us in the past and present, is more difficult than to conceive of
unconscious experiences—or experiences of the mind, stored away in
the memory, resulting from forgotten realizations.</p>

                <p>Leaving aside the prophetic nature of some dreams and likewise the
prophetic nature of many things seemingly drawn from the imagination,
we still have a great mass of facts and incidents resulting from dreams
and imagination, which coincide with experiences, facts and incidents
which have had actuality in the past, outside of our conscious knowledge.
And very often these actualities were in the remote past, in a period
beyond one’s present span of life. How came these facts and incidents
to be stored away in the memory to be recalled, reviewed, analyzed,
in the present span of life? This is the question which confronts the
scientist today. The present story attempts to throw some light on this
question and its possible answer. That the matter is presented in story
form rather than in heavy, scientific arguments, does not argue that the
principles involved are without scientific foundation, or that the process
whereby the “Yesterdays” are revealed is an unnatural, uncommon, or
unscientific process. It is, in fact, typical of the experiences of many
individuals and may find its similitude in some experiences of the
reader. </p>
                <p>With the sole idea that, in a pleasant, or at least fascinatingly strange
story, some w ill be brought to the threshold of realization that the
partially explored activities and functions of the mind contain many
profound mysteries and principles of considerable import, and that
those so illumined may be tempted to seek for more light in the
Chamber of the Unknown— this book is offered to those constantly
asking for the unusual in fiction and the mystical in romance.</p>
