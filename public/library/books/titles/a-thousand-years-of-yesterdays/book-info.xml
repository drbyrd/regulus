        <discription><![CDATA[<p>Here is a book that will tell you about the real facts of reincarnation. It is a story of the Soul, and explains in detail how the Soul enters the body and how it leaves it, where it goes, and when it comes back to earth again, and why. The story is not just a piece of fiction, but a revelation of the mystic laws and principles known to the Masters of the Far East and the Orient for many centuries, and never put into book form as a story before this book was printed. That is why the book has been translated into so many foreign languages and endorsed by the mystics and adepts of India, Persia, Egypt, and Tibet. Fascinating — Alluring— Instructive. Those who have read the book say that they were unable to leave it without finishing it at one sitting. The story reveals the mystic principles taught by the Rosicrucians in regard to reincarnation as well as the spiritual laws of the soul and the incarnations of the soul.</p>]]></discription>
